[{"categories":["Quantum Information"],"content":"Quantum State Tomography Quantum state tomography is the process of deducing the [quantum state] based on the [results of measurements on a quantum state ensemble]. Its formulation is straightforward, as follows: Given a series of measurement operators ${\\Pi_1, \\ldots, \\Pi_n}$ and their corresponding measurement probabilities $p_k = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\Pi_k]$, find the quantum state $\\rho$. In other words, in these $n$ equations $p_k = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\Pi_k]$, given $p_k$ and $\\Pi_k$, find $\\rho$. Conversely, if $\\rho$ and $p_k$ are known, and you want to find $\\Pi_k$, that’s called Detector tomography. However, that’s not the topic of this article. Why care about state tomography? Because we want to know what the quantum state prepared in the experiment looks like. The method is state tomography. From the equation $p_k = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\Pi_k]$, you can see that if $\\rho$ has $n$ degrees of freedom, we need at least $n$ measurement operators, and they must be “independent of each other.” This condition is known as tomographical completeness or informational completeness. Why is it called “Tomography”? State tomography is called “tomography” because the tomography of continuous-variable photon states is really similar to the CT (Computed Tomography) in hospitals. CT reconstructs a 3D image from projection images from various angles, while the tomography of continuous-variable photon states reconstructs the Wigner function from projection images at various angles. The latter is a kind of “two-dimensional image.” It’s also understandable with discrete variables because (von Neumann) measurement is essentially projection, and tomography is reconstructing the original quantum state from the measured projections. In short, tomography is named because it is the process of reconstructing the whole from projections.

For example, you can choose ${(\\mathbb{I} + X)/2,\\\\,\\\\, (\\mathbb{I} + Y)/2,\\\\,\\\\, (\\mathbb{I} + Z)/2 }$ as the three measurement operators (where $X, Y, Z$ are Pauli matrices). They correspond to the X, Y, Z axes on the Bloch sphere, which are equivalent to measuring the x, y, and z components of the Bloch vector. However, the issue is that in experiments, we do not directly measure probabilities but rather counts. If we want to know the probability $p_Z = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho (\\mathbb{I} + Z)/2] = \\langle0|\\rho|0\\rangle$, we must use counts $p_Z = \\frac{N_Z}{N_Z + N_{-Z}}$, while measuring $N_{-Z}$ requires another measurement operator $(\\mathbb{I} - Z)/2$. In general, since we measure counts and require normalization, the actual number of measurement operators required is always one more than the theoretical requirement. And the degrees of freedom for the density operator of $N$ qubits is $4^n - 1$, and adding one precisely equals $4^n$. For $n = 1$, we need four measurement operators. This was also the method adopted by the earliest article on photon state tomography[1]. Okay, let’s dive deeper into the state tomography of a single qubit, which will help us expand to multiple qubits later. A qubit’s density operator is $\\rho = \\frac{\\mathbb{I} + xX + yY + zZ}{2}$. Tomography involves solving for $x, y, z$. As mentioned earlier, we choose four measurement operators: ${(\\mathbb{I} + X)/2,\\\\,\\\\, (\\mathbb{I} + Y)/2,\\\\,\\\\, (\\mathbb{I} + Z)/2,\\\\,\\\\, (\\mathbb{I} - Z)/2 }$. Thus, the measured counts are: $N_X = N p_X = N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\frac{\\mathbb{I} + X}{2}] = N \\frac{1 + x}{2}$, $N_Y = N p_Y = N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\frac{\\mathbb{I} + Y}{2}] = N \\frac{1 + y}{2}$, $N_Z = N p_Z = N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\frac{\\mathbb{I} + Z}{2}] = N \\frac{1 + z}{2}$, $N_{-Z} = N p_{-Z} = N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\frac{\\mathbb{I} - Z}{2}] = N \\frac{1 - z}{2}$. By solving these four equations together, we can find the unknowns $x, y, z, N$. Okay, that’s it. It’s that simple.

Observant readers might notice that the density operator must be positive definite, but the above solution process doesn’t guarantee positive definiteness. In fact, following the above steps, it is entirely possible to derive non-positive-definite density operators. In other words, the result might be “non-physical.” This is because experimental data is subject to error, which can lead to non-physical results under certain conditions. Note, this is not due to errors caused by an imperfect experimental system but by quantum statistical errors, or fluctuations. For example, for coherent states, the count distribution is Poissonian, with variance equal to the mean. When time is limited, and not much data can be collected, the relative error $\\frac{\\Delta N}{N} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$ might be quite high. Some might suggest: “What if we add a constraint to ensure positive definiteness?” In this example, as long as we require $|x|, |y|, |z| \\leq 1$, positive definiteness can be guaranteed. But here’s the problem: Adding constraints leads to no solution when faced with errors. Okay, given that no solution is caused by errors, we can resort to a different approach, converting the problem from [solving equations] to [fitting]. What is fitting? We know that two points determine a straight line. However, if the data points themselves have large errors, we might need many points, which almost certainly do not lie on a single straight line. In this case, there’s no solution for the straight-line equation. Even with no solution, we can fit! Using the least-squares method! So where does the least-squares method come from? The answer is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The basic idea behind MLE is to find a straight line (among many) that is most likely to generate the measured points. The specific implementation involves setting a likelihood function with straight-line parameters as independent variables, where the function value represents the probability of measuring these results with the given straight-line parameters. The whole problem then becomes an optimization problem: Find the maximum value of the likelihood function and its corresponding straight-line parameters. In many cases, experimental errors are assumed to follow a normal distribution, so the likelihood function is exponential in the form $L = e^{-\\mathcal{L}}$. By taking the logarithm of the likelihood function and inverting it, we get a new likelihood function, $\\mathcal{L}$, and the optimization problem becomes finding the minimum value of the new likelihood function. This new likelihood function can generally be interpreted as “given this straight line, the total error between the theoretical and actual measurements.” All of these ideas can be directly applied to our state tomography. We can set a likelihood function with the degrees of freedom for the positive-definite matrix $\\rho(x,y,z)$, where the function value is the probability of measuring the observed results given quantum state $\\rho$. Let’s convert these ideas into an algorithm: Define a valid density operator $\\rho(x,y,z) = \\frac{\\mathbb{I} + xX + yY + zZ}{2}$, with $|x|, |y|, |z| \\leq 1$. Define the likelihood function as the probability of measuring the observed results, given quantum state $\\rho$: $ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{L}(x,y,z) \u0026= P(N_1 = n_1, N_2 = n_2, \\ldots) \\\\ \u0026= \\prod_k \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(n_k - \\hat{n}_k)^2}{2\\hat{n}_k}\\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\prod_k \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(n_k - N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\Pi_k])^2}{2N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\Pi_k]}\\right] \\end{aligned} $ In this case, we use the continuous normal distribution instead of the discrete Poisson distribution because when counts are large (typically a few hundred to a few thousand), the normal distribution can closely approximate the Poisson distribution. More importantly, the likelihood function of the normal distribution provides an unbiased estimate, just as effective as the Poisson ","date":"2024-04-22","objectID":"/state_tomography/:3:0","tags":["Quantum Optics"],"title":"Quantum state tomography","uri":"/state_tomography/"},{"categories":["Quantum Information"],"content":"State tomography of multiple qubits The density matrix of n qubits has $4^n -1$ degrees of freedom.

In general, for polarization-encoded photon qubits, we simply use six projection measurements—H, V, D, A, R, L—and their combinations (they are easy to implement, requiring only wave plates). For n qubits, there are $6^n\u003e4^n$ projection operators, which is sufficient. Since $(|H\\rangle\\langle H|, |V\\rangle\\langle V|)$ form a POVM, $(|D\\rangle\\langle D|, |A\\rangle\\langle A|)$ form a POVM, and $(|R\\rangle\\langle R|, |L\\rangle\\langle L|)$ form a POVM, which means six projection measurements correspond to three POVMs. Thus, we need $3^n$ POVMs, or $3^n$ measurement settings (where “measurement settings” refer to wave plate angles). However, there is a question: is there a better way to reduce the number of POVMs, thereby reducing the time required for tomography? After all, $6^n\u003e4^n$ is redundant. From this point, you could say it’s on the academic frontier, where I could promote some of our group’s work. More on this later, haha.

The reason we care about continuous variables is that photons are fundamentally harmonic oscillators, not two-level systems. Considering the former is more natural and aligns better with the nature of photons. Indeed, the classical electromagnetic waves in our daily life are a type of continuous-variable photonic state (coherent state). A single-mode continuous-variable photonic state can be described by quasi-probability distribution functions. There are three such functions: Glauber P-, Husimi Q-, and Wigner functions, referred to as P-, Q-, and W-, respectively. Among them, only the Wigner function’s marginal distributions correspond to actual observable probability distributions, which is why we typically consider the Wigner function. What is the Wigner function? How do we understand the Wigner function? Let’s start from classical electromagnetic waves. We know that single-mode (monochromatic) electromagnetic waves can be described by a point on the complex plane (i.e., using a phasor diagram). Superposition of electromagnetic waves directly corresponds to complex number addition (or vector addition). This so-called phasor representation can be immediately extended to quantum mechanics. For a quantized single-mode classical electromagnetic field, its phasor representation is no longer an infinitesimal point but a circle with a certain size. In fact, it is a Gaussian function on the complex plane, with the standard deviation determined by the uncertainty principle. This Gaussian function is the Wigner function of the classical electromagnetic wave, and its marginal distribution corresponds to the probability distribution of the quadrature field strength (the electric field is also an observable and has uncertainty). The quantum state obtained by quantizing a classical electromagnetic wave is called the Coherent state. For a more general quantum optical field, its Wigner function can have strange shapes and can even take on negative values. However, this does not mean we get negative probabilities—after taking the marginal distribution, we always get a non-negative probability. This is because the area occupied by these negative values is small enough to be smaller than the area allowed by the uncertainty principle, meaning the uncertainty principle ensures that we cannot observe negative probability. Some interesting Wigner functions for photon states. The left image shows a squeezed state, and the right image shows a Schrödinger cat state. State tomography of continuous-variable photon states is completed by measuring quadrature. In this case, all measurement operators have the following form: $\\begin{aligned} \\Pi_\\theta = \\frac{ae^{-i\\theta}+a^\\dag e^{i\\theta}}{2} \\end{aligned}$ This is the so-called “quadrature” (I don’t know the Chinese translation). Conceptually, it projects the entire Wigner function onto a straight line, with this line making an angle $\\theta$ with the x-axis. Quantum state tomography of continuous-variable optical states Quantum information theory tells us that if we want to reconstruct the Wigner function with infinite precision, we need infinitely many values of $\\theta$, which means countless measurement operators. Of course, we don’t need infinite precision, so we only need to take $\\theta$ at some reasonable intervals. For example, taking steps of 0.01 radians from 0 to 2pi. After obtaining the probability density function of the quadrature, we can use the inverse Radon transform to reconstruct the Wigner function. This is similar to the principle used in hospital CT scans. As for how to measure quadratures experimentally, it’s simple: like in radio technology, mix the signal with a local oscillator. This is called homodyne measurement. Specifically, this involves mixing the signal to be measured wi","date":"2024-04-22","objectID":"/state_tomography/:6:0","tags":["Quantum Optics"],"title":"Quantum state tomography","uri":"/state_tomography/"},{"categories":["Quantum Information"],"content":"Appendix: Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Poisson Distribution The likelihood function corresponding to the Poisson distribution is as follows: $ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{t}) \u0026= P(N_1=n_1,N_2=n_2,\\cdots) \\\\ \u0026= \\prod_k e^{-\\lambda_k} \\frac{\\lambda_k^{n_k}}{n_k!} \\\\ \u0026\\xrightarrow{-\\log} \\sum_k (\\lambda_k - n_k \\log \\lambda_k + \\cancel{\\log n_k!}) \\\\ \u0026\\xrightarrow{\\frac{1}{N}} \\sum_k(\\hat{p}_k(\\mathbf{t})-p_k \\log \\hat{p}_k(\\mathbf{t})) \\end{aligned}$ where $\\lambda_k = N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho(\\mathbf{t}) \\Pi_k] = N \\hat{p}_k(\\mathbf{t})$.

For example, differentials are linear, but manifolds are curved, so we need to define something linear within this curvature. This linear thing is the tangent space. As the name suggests, the tangent space is a tangent plane to a curved surface at a certain point. But how do we define it? The curvature here is not embedded in another space but intrinsic to space itself. We cannot find the equation of a tangent plane as in classical analytic geometry. Let’s try a different approach: Firstly, it is linear, which means it is a vector space. A vector space is a group equipped with scalar multiplication. Specifically, its elements (called vectors) satisfy the following properties: (1) Commutativity of vector addition (2) Associativity of vector addition (3) Existence of an identity element for vector addition (similar to zero) (4) Existence of an inverse element for vector addition (similar to the negative number) The above four properties indicate that the vector space is an abelian group with respect to vector addition. (5) Existence of a multiplicative identity for scalar multiplication (6) Associativity of scalar multiplication (7) Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition (8) Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to scalar addition A vector space does not have to be $\\mathbb{R}^n,,\\mathbb{C}^n$, as long as a set is defined with addition and scalar multiplication operations satisfying the above properties, it is a vector space.

It can be proven that the collection of $v$ forms a vector space. Although this definition seems complicated, it is actually just finding the directional derivative of a function at a certain point. Taking a bivariate function as an example, we can explicitly write out an instance of $v$: $\\left(a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\\bigg|_p$ If $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_p,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_p)$ is taken as the basis, then its coordinates are $(a,b)$. This linear space is the tangent space at point $p$ on the manifold, denoted as $T_pM$. All these operations are at a certain point $p$, where each point grows a tangent space.

In other words, the differential at a certain point is a cotangent vector. Elements in the dual space (cotangent vectors) are linear functionals that map elements in the original space to a number.

In fact, the differential is the linear mapping characterized by the Jacobian matrix. Below, we explain in detail. For a univariate function, the Jacobian matrix is just the derivative. Although we are used to thinking of derivatives as slopes, let’s change our perspective: If you consider the action of a univariate function as stretching along the number line, then the derivative is the local stretching ratio. The advantage of this perspective is its ease of generalization to multivariate functions. Because, for multivariate functions, you often cannot draw a curve as you would for univariate functions. So, as an alternative method, you can think of a multivariate function as a space being stretched, such as $f: R^2→R^2$. You can imagine that each point in $R^2$ is stretched to a new point by $f$. If you zoom in on this local stretch, it looks like the case of a univariate function—linear—parallel lines are stretched to parallel lines. And what we call the differential is precisely this local linear mapping! The matrix of this linear mapping is the Jacobian matrix.

The Hamiltonian for this process is given by: $H = i\\hbar g,a^\\dag_s a^\\dag_i a_p + h.c.$ where $g$ represents the interaction strength. When the pump photon is strong enough that its intensity is almost unaffected, we can focus only on the subspace of signal and idler photons. In this case, the Hamiltonian becomes: $H = i\\hbar g \\alpha_p ,a^\\dag_s a^\\dag_i + h.c.$ Without loss of generality, let $\\alpha_p$ be a real number, and let $\\chi=g\\alpha_p$. Then, $H = i\\hbar \\chi (a^\\dag_s a^\\dag_i - a_s a_i)$ In reality, due to the finite spatial extent of the pump, there will be uncertainty in momentum, manifested as a finite linewidth in the spectrum. In this case, the Hamiltonian becomes: $\\begin{aligned} H=i\\hbar \\chi \\int d\\omega_s d\\omega_i [f(\\omega_s,\\omega_i) a_s^\\dag(\\omega_s) a_i^\\dag(\\omega_i) -f^*(\\omega_s,\\omega_i) a_s(\\omega_s) a_i(\\omega_i)] \\end{aligned}$ Now, we expand $f(\\omega_s,\\omega_i)$ using a set of orthogonal basis functions (e.g., Hermite functions) ${\\varphi_k}_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}$: $\\begin{aligned} f(\\omega_s,\\omega_i)=\\sum_{k,l} C_{kl}\\varphi_k(\\omega_s)\\varphi_l(\\omega_i) \\end{aligned}$ and denote $a_k^\\dag = \\int d\\omega_s ,\\varphi_k(\\omega_s)a_s^\\dag(\\omega_s),\\quad b_k^\\dag = \\int d\\omega_i ,\\varphi_k(\\omega_i) a_i^\\dag(\\omega_i)$ , then we have $\\begin{aligned} H=i\\hbar \\chi \\sum_{k,l}\\left( C_{kl}a^\\dag_k b^\\dag_l - C^*_{kl} a_kb_l\\right) \\end{aligned}$ Performing a Schmidt decomposition (singular value decomposition) on it, we get $\\begin{aligned} H=i\\hbar \\chi \\sum_{k}\\left( \\lambda_k A^\\dag_k B^\\dag_k - \\lambda_k A_k B_k\\right) \\end{aligned}$ where $\\sum_k\\lambda^2_k=1$. Note: Since the spectrum of singular value decomposition is always non-negative real numbers, $\\lambda_k$ is real and greater than zero. This is actually the Hamiltonian of multimode squeezed states. Review of various squeezed states: Single-mode squeezed state: $\\begin{aligned} H=i\\hbar\\left(g^*\\frac{a^2}{2}-g\\frac{a^{\\dag2}}{2}\\right) \\end{aligned}$ Two-mode squeezed state: $\\begin{aligned} H=i\\hbar\\left(g^*a b-g a^\\dag b^\\dag\\right) \\end{aligned}$ Multimode squeezed state: $\\begin{aligned} H=i\\hbar\\sum_{k}\\left(g_k^*a_k b_k-g_k a_k^\\dag b_k^\\dag\\right) \\end{aligned}$ Now let’s separately look at the system evolution in the Schrödinger picture and the Heisenberg picture. In the Schrödinger picture, $\\begin{aligned} |\\Psi_{\\text{out}}\\rangle \u0026=e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}}|\\Psi_{\\text{in}}\\rangle \\\\ \u0026= \\sum_{k} \\frac{1}{\\cosh(r_k)}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\tanh^n(r_k)|n_k,n_k\\rangle \\end{aligned}$ where $r_k=\\chi \\tau \\lambda_k$ . Note that it resembles a thermal light field. When $r_k$ is small, we have $|\\Psi_{\\text{out}}\\rangle\\approx \\sum_{k} \\left(|0_k,0_k\\rangle + r_k|1_k,1_k\\rangle\\right)$ This is also the case that most experiments conform to. Conditioned on detecting photons, the conditional state is $|\\Psi_{\\text{conditional}}\\rangle=\\sum_k\\lambda_k|1_k,1_k\\rangle$ . This is the principle of heralded single-photon sources. In the Heisenberg picture, $\\begin{aligned} A_k \u0026\\rightarrow e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}} A_k e^{-\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}} \\\\ \u0026= A_k + [e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}},A_k]+[e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}},[e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}},A_k]] + \\cdots \\\\ \u0026=\\cosh(r_k) A_k - \\sinh(r_k)B_k^\\dag \\end{aligned}$ $\\begin{aligned} B_k \u0026\\rightarrow e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}} B_k e^{-\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}} \\\\ \u0026= B_k + [e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}},B_k]+[e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}},[e^{\\frac{H\\tau}{i\\hbar}},B_k]] + \\cdots \\\\ \u0026=\\cosh(r_k) B_k - \\sinh(r_k)A_k^\\","date":"2024-03-10","objectID":"/hbt_spectral_correlation/:1:0","tags":["Quantum Optics"],"title":"Probing the spectral purity with unheralded g2 measurements in HBT experiment","uri":"/hbt_spectral_correlation/"},{"categories":["Quantum Information"],"content":"How to Characterize Spectral Correlation? Spectral correlation refers to the correlation between the spectra of the signal photon and the idler photon. An uncorrelated joint spectrum can be written as the product of the spectra of the two photons: $f(\\omega_s,\\omega_i)=\\phi(\\omega_s)\\psi(\\omega_i)$ . If it cannot be written in this form, it implies spectral correlation. How to characterize spectral correlation specifically? We can use the Schmidt number to quantify the degree of spectral correlation, defined as follows: $\\begin{aligned} K= \\frac{1}{\\sum_k\\lambda^4_k} \\end{aligned}$ Example For an uncorrelated joint spectrum, ${\\lambda_k}={1}$ , $K=1$ . For a joint spectrum with two modes and equal coefficients, ${\\lambda_k}={\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}$ , $K=2$ . For a joint spectrum with n modes and equal coefficients, $K=n$ . For a joint spectrum with n modes and coefficients not completely equal to each other, $1\u003cK\u003cn$ . Why do we care about spectral correlation? Because it is closely related to the purity of photons: Property When $r_k$ is small and photons are detected, the quantum state is $|\\Psi_{\\text{conditional}}\\rangle=\\sum_k\\lambda_k|1_k,1_k\\rangle$ . For this quantum state, tracing out one of the two photons (performing partial trace operation), the purity of the remaining photon state is $P=\\frac{1}{K}$ . This is because: $\\begin{aligned} P \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}[\\operatorname{tr}_2[|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|]^2] \\\\ \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\operatorname{tr}_B\\left(\\sum_{k}\\lambda_k \\left| 1_k, 1_k\\right\\rangle\\sum_{l}\\lambda_l \\left\\langle 1_l ,1_l\\right|\\right)^2\\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{k}\\lambda_k^2 \\left|1_k \\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 1_k\\right|\\right)^2\\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\sum_{k}\\left(\\lambda_k^2\\left| 1_k \\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 1_k\\right|\\right)^2\\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\sum_{k}\\lambda_k^4 |1_k\\rangle\\langle 1_k|\\right] \\\\ \u0026=\\sum_{k}\\lambda_k^4=\\frac{1}{K} \\end{aligned}$ It can be seen that the purity is inversely proportional to the Schmidt number. That is, the stronger the spectral correlation, the lower the purity of the photons in the frequency domain. This is unfavorable for heralded single-photon sources and various multi-photon interference experiments. For the former, spectral correlation will reduce the frequency-domain indistinguishability of single photons, and for the latter, spectral correlation will reduce the interference contrast.

In this experiment, a beam of light is split into two using a 50:50 beamsplitter, and then each beam is detected separately by two detectors. The correlation of the intensities on both sides is measured as a function of delay, as shown in the figure below: Hanbury Brown and Twiss Experiment The classical normalized g2 is defined as: $\\begin{aligned} g^{(2)}(r_1, r_2; \\tau) \u0026= \\frac{\\langle E^*(r_1, t) E^*(r_2, t + \\tau) E(r_2, t + \\tau) E(r_1, t) \\rangle}{\\langle |E(r_1, t)|^2 \\rangle \\langle |E(r_2, t + \\tau)|^2 \\rangle} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{\\langle I(r_1, t) I(r_2, t + \\tau) \\rangle}{\\langle I(r_1, t) \\rangle \\langle I(r_2, t + \\tau) \\rangle} \\end{aligned}$ where $E$ represents the electric field and $I$ represents the intensity.

Additionally, the creation operator must precede the annihilation operator since the detection of a photon is an annihilation process, unlike the classical case. In classical coherent states $|\\alpha\\rangle$, the annihilation operator $a$ is an eigenstate $a|\\alpha\\rangle = \\alpha|\\alpha\\rangle$, hence the presence or absence of a photon makes no difference. In the case of single-mode, since $E^+ = i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2\\epsilon_0 V}}a$ and $E^- = i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2\\epsilon_0 V}}a^\\dagger$, the quantum g2 can be simplified to: $\\begin{aligned} g^{(2)}(r_1, r_2, \\tau) \u0026= \\frac{\\langle a^\\dagger(r_1, t) a^\\dagger(r_2, t + \\tau) a(r_2, t + \\tau) a(r_1, t) \\rangle}{\\langle n(r_1, t) \\rangle \\langle n(r_2, t + \\tau) \\rangle} \\end{aligned}$ Therefore, to measure quantum g2, we need to replace intensity detectors with photon detectors, and these photon detectors should be capable of distinguishing photon numbers. However, the problem arises because currently available single-photon detectors that can distinguish photon numbers are not very practical: TES detectors have long recovery times; schemes for Demultiplexing in space and time only offer pseudo-photon number resolution; and SNSPDs are expensive, require low temperatures, and their multi-photon efficiency may not be very high.

Comment: “Cannot distinguish photon numbers” means they can only differentiate between “no photons” and “one or more photons.” Common APD detectors cannot distinguish photon numbers. The method is simple: just make sure the quantum efficiency of the NPNR-SPD is low enough! Quantum efficiency $\\eta$ refers to the probability that the detector can detect a photon given that a photon enters it. Conversely, the probability of the photon being “lost” is $1 - \\eta$. At first, it seemed strange to me why lower efficiency is better. But with a little thought, the principle becomes clear: When the efficiency is low enough, the probability that $k$ photons are not all lost is $1 - (1 - \\eta)^k \\approx k\\eta$. In other words, the probability of the NPNR-SPD detecting a photon is proportional to $k$. Thus, we achieve “photon number resolution” indirectly through “low efficiency”. The following is a formal (boring) mathematical derivation, which can be skipped: [Derivation equations] Measuring g2 has several uses.

By performing spectral decomposition on the self-adjoint operator corresponding to the observable, denoted as $ O = \\sum_i \\lambda_i |\\varphi_i\\rangle\\langle\\varphi_i| $, we obtain these projection operators $ |\\varphi_i\\rangle\\langle\\varphi_i| $. This part is well-known to students who have studied elementary quantum mechanics. Besides the Von Neumann measurement, there is a more general type of measurement called Generalized Measurements or Positive Operator Valued Measures (POVMs). Generalized Measurements (POVMs) Definition: POVM A POVM is a mapping $ \\mathsf{E}: X \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}) $, satisfying $ \\mathsf{E}(x) \\ge 0, \\quad \\forall x \\in X $ $ \\sum_ {x \\in X} \\mathsf{E}(x) = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{H}} $ where $ X $ represents the set of possible measurement outcomes, and $ \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}) $ represents the set of all bounded operators on $ \\mathcal{H} $. Born’s Rule The probability of obtaining result $ x $ when measuring a quantum state $ \\rho $ with a POVM $ \\mathsf{E} $ is given by $ p_{\\rho}^{\\mathsf{E}}(x) = \\operatorname{tr}[\\rho \\mathsf{E}(x)] $. When I first encountered POVMs, I was not clear about how they are implemented. This is because traditional measurements involve projection operators satisfying $ \\mathsf{E}(x)^2 = \\mathsf{E}(x), \\quad \\forall x \\in X $. However, general POVMs do not satisfy this condition. In fact, traditional projection measurements, also known as PVMs (Projection Valued Measures), are a special type of POVM. PVMs are to POVMs what pure states are to mixed states. In other words, a POVM is a statistical mixture of PVMs, just as a mixed state is a statistical mixture of pure states. Implementing POVMs So, how do we implement POVMs? We can actually use PVMs and composite systems to implement POVMs. Consider a system with a Hilbert space $ \\mathcal{H} $ and a state $ \\rho $. Next, we couple system $ \\mathcal{H} $ with another system $ \\mathcal{K} $. Suppose the initial state of system $ \\mathcal{K} $ is $ \\sigma $. Then, the initial state of the composite system is $ \\rho \\otimes \\sigma $ in $ \\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{K} $. After that, we let the composite system evolve for a period of time, resulting in the system’s state becoming $ U(\\rho \\otimes \\sigma) U^\\dag $. Finally, we perform a PVM $ \\mathsf{Z} $ measurement on subsystem $ \\mathcal{K} $. According to Born’s rule, the probability of obtaining result $ x $ is $ \\operatorname{tr}[U(\\rho\\otimes \\sigma) U^\\dag(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{H}}\\otimes \\mathsf{Z}(x))] $. Thus, we have implemented a POVM $ \\mathsf{E} $ such that $ \\operatorname{tr}[\\rho \\mathsf{E}(x)] = \\operatorname{tr}[U(\\rho\\otimes \\sigma) U^\\dag(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{H}}\\otimes \\mathsf{Z}(x))] $. Measurement Model Let’s summarize the physical objects involved in implementing POVMs: the ancilla system $ \\mathcal{K} $, the initial state $ \\sigma $ of system $ \\mathcal{K} $, the evolution $ U $ of the composite system, and the projection measurement $ \\mathsf{Z} $ on the ancilla system. These physical objects together realize a POVM measurement. So, we can define $ \\mathfrak{M} = (\\mathcal{K},\\sigma,U,\\mathsf{Z}) $ as a Measurement Model. In actual experiments, the ancilla system $ \\mathcal{K} $ can be considered as a probe of the instrument, and $ \\mathsf{Z} $ is the readout of the probe. Post-Measurement State POVMs themselves cannot determine the post-measurement state. The actual determination of the post-measurement state depends on the specific implementation of the measurement, that is, the measurement model. For a measurement model $ \\mathfrak{M} = (\\mathcal{K},\\sigma,U,\\mathsf{Z}) $, the post-measurement state of system $ \\mathcal{H} $ is $ \\rho_x = \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathcal{K}}[U(\\rho\\otimes \\sigma) U^\\dag(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{H}}\\otimes \\mathsf{Z}(x))] $, where $ \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathcal{K}}[\\cdot] $ denotes the partial","date":"2024-03-10","objectID":"/povm/:0:0","tags":["Quantum Measurement Theory"],"title":"POVM: a brief introduction","uri":"/povm/"},{"categories":["Quantum Information"],"content":"The wave function of a photon in the spacetime representation is: $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)=\\langle \\mathbf{r},t|\\psi\\rangle=\\langle 0 |E^{+}(\\mathbf{r},t)|\\psi\\rangle$ Where $\\begin{aligned} |\\mathbf{r},t\\rangle = E^{-}(\\mathbf{r},t) |0\\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k},\\lambda} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2 \\epsilon_0 V}} e^{\\mathrm{i}(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}-\\omega_{\\mathbf{k}} t)} a^\\dag_{\\mathbf{k},\\lambda} |0\\rangle \\end{aligned}$.

When we talk about the spacetime modes of photons, such as Gaussian pulses, hyperbolic secant pulses, etc., we are actually referring to the wave function in the spacetime representation described above. Of course, this wave function is not in the “Schrödinger sense” because the Schrödinger equation belongs to non-relativistic quantum mechanics, while photons are relativistic particles. When we say that photons do not have a well-defined wave function, we are actually saying that they do not have a well-defined position operator. But we do have field operators $E^{\\pm}(\\mathbf{r},t)$, so we don’t need a position operator either. The tern “photon wave function” is nowadays common in literature.

Let’s move on to something more useful: Example 3: Two-mode Squeezed State The Hamiltonian is: $\\begin{aligned} H=i\\hbar\\left(g^*a b-g a^\\dag b^\\dag\\right) \\end{aligned}$ $\\begin{aligned} a \u0026\\rightarrow e^{\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}} a e^{-\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}} \\\\ \u0026= a + \\left[{\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}},a\\right]+\\left[{\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}},\\left[{\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}},a\\right]\\right] + \\cdots \\\\ \u0026=\\cosh(r) a - \\sinh(r)e^{i\\xi}b^\\dag \\end{aligned}$ Where $g = re^{i\\xi}$. This is well-known for SPDC and OPO. It’s difficult to compute in the Schrödinger picture, but it’s much easier using the Heisenberg picture with BCH formula. Example 4: Rotated Quadratures The generator is the total particle number $N$, canonical position operator $Q$, and canonical momentum operator $P$ evolve as: $\\begin{aligned} e^{i\\theta N} Q e^{-i\\theta N} = \\cos \\theta, Q + i \\sin \\theta, P \\\\ e^{i\\theta N} P e^{-i\\theta N} = i \\sin \\theta, Q + \\cos \\theta P \\end{aligned}$ It looks like rotating the phase space, similar to the Phase Shifter. This transformation is useful for handling Squeezed states. Even a subordinate of the BCH formula is so useful, isn’t the original formula even more powerful? Now, let’s introduce the original: $e^{X}e^{Y}=e^Z$ $Z=X+Y+{\\frac {1}{2}}[X,Y]+{\\frac {1}{12}}[X,[X,Y]]-{\\frac {1}{12}}[Y,[X,Y]]+\\cdots $ Uh, it seems a bit less practical. In reality, we often use a special case, where $[X,Y]$ is a constant, in which case the BCH formula becomes $Z=X+Y+{\\frac {1}{2}}[X,Y]$ Example 5: Displacement Operator $\\begin{aligned} D(\\alpha)\u0026=e^{\\alpha a^\\dag-\\alpha^* a} \\\\ \u0026=e^{-\\frac{1}{2}|\\alpha|^2}e^{\\alpha a^\\dag}e^{-\\alpha^* a} \\\\ \u0026=e^{\\frac{1}{2}|\\alpha|^2}e^{-\\alpha^* a}e^{\\alpha a^\\dag} \\end{aligned}$ It’s evident that the BCH formula allows us to switch flexibly between normal ordering (creation operators before annihilation operators) and anti-normal ordering. In fact, the displacement operator itself is neither normally ordered nor anti-normally ordered but symmetrically ordered. Example 6: Weyl Operator $W(q,p) = e^{i(-qP+pQ)} = e^{\\frac{i}{2}qp}U(q)V(p) = e^{-\\frac{i}{2}qp}V(p)U(q)$ Where $U(q)=e^{-iqP}$ is the position translation operator, $V(p)=e^{ipQ}$ is the momentum translation operator. According to the BCH formula, we can decouple them. This $W:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(L^2(\\mathbb{R}))$ is called the Weyl Representation. More generally, the Weyl Transformation can quantize a probability density function in classical phase space into a density operator, conversely, the Wigner Transformation can map a density operator to a probability density function in phase space, which is called the Wigner Representation in quantum optics.

Set the value of all registers to their default values. Next, depending on your needs, configure the SPI controller. For example, the clock mode (CPHA and CPOL) and slave select mode (auto or manual). Then, depending on the number of bytes need to be written and read, write to the DTR (Data Transmit Register) the corresponding number of bytes. Each written byte will be shifted into the TX FIFO. Note: If the number of written bytes is n_tx and the number of read bytes is n_rx, then we should not only write n_tx bytes to the DTR, but also write another n_rx “dummy” bytes. This is because SPI, in nature, is a full-duplex protocol – in order to receive n_rx bytes, you also need to send n_rx bytes. Finally, read the bytes out of the DRR (Data Receive Register). When the DRR is read, the read byte will be dequed. Note: depending on the scene, when receiving from the slave, the programmer may need to discard the first n_tx bytes. This is because when the master is sending data/instructions, the slave may not yet respond. Rather, the slave will not respond until the master has sent all of the bytes (instruction \u0026 data). But due to the full-duplex nature of the SPI protocol, the first n_tx dummy bytes will also be pushed into the RX FIFO. Therefore, one may need to discard those bytes. If we use the manual slave select mode, we should assert the SS signal before the transfer and de-assert the SS signal after the transfer. The following code sends two bytes [0x00 0x37] to the slave and reads one byte from the slave. #include \"xspi.h\" // axi quad spi #include \"xparameters.h\" #include \"xstatus.h\" #include \"xplatform_info.h\" #include \"xil_printf.h\" #include \"sleep.h\" #define SPI_DEVICE_ID XPAR_SPI_0_DEVICE_ID #define SPI_BASEADDR XPAR_SPI_0_BASEADDR XSpi Spi; int main() { /* * SPI Initialize */ XSpi_Config *spi_config_ptr; spi_config_ptr = XSpi_LookupConfig(SPI_DEVICE_ID); if (spi_config_ptr == NULL) { return XST_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND; } status = XSpi_CfgInitialize(\u0026Spi, spi_config_ptr, spi_config_ptr-\u003eBaseAddress); if (status != XST_SUCCESS) { return XST_FAILURE; } // Start the SPI driver so that the device is enabled.

In /dev/spidevx.y, x stands for the x-th SPI controller, and y stands for the y-th chip. The device tree is usually initialized during boot-up and is read-only. However, after the 4.14 version of the Linux kernel, we can use the “device tree overlay” (briefed as DTO from now on) to dynamically add incremental device trees. Below is a code snippet of DTO. /dts-v1/; /plugin/; / { fragment@0 { target = \u003c\u0026amba\u003e; overlay0: __overlay__ { axi_quad_spi_0: axi_quad_spi@80000000 { ... status = \"okay\"; #address-cells = \u003c1\u003e; #size-cells = \u003c0\u003e; spidev0: spidev@0 { compatible = \"spidev\"; reg = \u003c0\u003e; spi-max-frequency = \u003c5000000\u003e; }; }; }; }; }; Some points to be noted: We should add one more line /plugin/; after /dts-v1/; to show that this is an DTO file rather than an ordinary device tree file. target stands for which node is to be modified. Here it is \u003c\u0026amba\u003e, and it will be extended to the phandle of the node which has the symbol amba. For example, if the phandle of amba is 70, then \u003c\u0026amba\u003e virtually stands for \u003c70\u003e. A phandle uniquely denotes a node and is usually allocated by the device tree compiler. In most cases, we should add the -@ compiler option, which enables support for symbol. Otherwise we can only reference the nodes by their phandle, which requires de-compiling the device tree binaries.

They are actually executed together. To verify this, we can add some delays: import asyncio import time async def coro_1(): print(\"I am the coroutine 1.\") await asyncio.sleep(1) async def coro_2(): print(\"I am the coroutine 2.\") await asyncio.sleep(1) async def main(): st = time.time() task_1 = asyncio.create_task(coro_1()) task_2 = asyncio.create_task(coro_2()) await task_1 await task_2 et = time.time() print(\"Elapsed: %f s\" % (et - st)) asyncio.run(main()) The results are: I am the coroutine 1.

Specifically, if the manifold is equipped with an inner product $\\langle\\mathrm{d}x^i,\\mathrm{d}x^j\\rangle=\\delta^{j}_i$, then we have: $$ \\star(\\mathrm{d}x^i \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^j) = \\mathrm{d}x^k $$ $$\\star\\mathrm{d}x^i = \\mathrm{d}x^j\\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k$$ $$\\star(f\\, \\mathrm{d}x^i \\wedge\\mathrm{d}x^j\\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k) = f$$ $$\\star f = f\\mathrm{d}x^i \\wedge\\mathrm{d}x^j\\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k$$ where $(i,j,k)$ is an even permutation of $(1,2,3)$. Also, note that we use a raised symbol: $\\sharp$. This is because the curl operates on tangent vector fields, not cotangent vector fields. Specifically, the curl $\\nabla\\times$ maps a tangent vector field to another tangent vector field: $\\Gamma(TM)\\rightarrow \\Gamma(TM)$. However, $f\\in \\Gamma(T^*M)$ is a cotangent vector field (a 1-form), so we first need to “raise” it to a tangent vector field: $f^\\sharp\\in \\Gamma(TM)$. This is actually the well-known index raising and lowering in physics: $g^{ij}X_i=X^j$. Similarly, $\\flat$ represents lowering a tangent vector field to a cotangent vector field: $g_{ij}X^i=X_j$. Returning to the previous example, we have a canonical isomorphism induced by the inner product: $$ \\sharp: \\star \\mathrm{d}f \\mapsto \\nabla\\times f^\\sharp $$ or written as: $$ (\\star \\mathrm{d}f)^\\sharp = \\nabla\\times f^\\sharp $$ or written as: $$ \\star \\mathrm{d}f(v) = \\langle\\nabla\\times f^\\sharp\\mid v\\rangle $$ where $f$ is a 1-form. We can also write it as: $\\nabla\\times F=(\\star \\mathrm{d} (F^\\flat))^\\sharp$ where $F=f^\\sharp$ is a tangent vector field, and $f$ is a cotangent vector field (a 1-form). Inspired by the above example, we can define the curl as: $$ \\begin{aligned} (\\nabla\\times) : \\quad \u0026 \\Gamma(TM)\\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\bigwedge^{n-2}TM\\right) \\\\ \u0026 F \\mapsto (\\star \\mathrm{d} (F^\\flat))^\\sharp \\end{aligned} $$ whe","date":"2023-06-10","objectID":"/curl_in_n_dimension/:0:3","tags":["Vector Calculus"],"title":"Curl in high dimension","uri":"/curl_in_n_dimension/"},{"categories":["Mathematical Physics"],"content":"1 Introduction In physics textbooks, we often come across the terms “pseudo-vector” and “pseudo-scalar.” In fact, on a 3-dimensional manifold, a “pseudo-vector” is the exterior product of two tangent vectors, denoted as $v\\in T_pM\\wedge T_pM=\\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$, while a “pseudo-scalar” is the exterior product of three tangent vectors, denoted as $s\\in T_pM\\wedge T_pM\\wedge T_pM=\\bigwedge^3(T_pM)$. When equipped with an inner product (or non-degenerate bilinear form), there exists a Hodge duality between $\\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$ and $\\bigwedge^1(T_pM)$, which leads us to mistakenly consider the pseudo-vector as a vector. Similarly, due to the Hodge duality between $\\bigwedge^3(T_pM)$ and $\\bigwedge^0(T_pM)$ (scalar fields), we mistakenly treat the pseudo-scalar as a scalar. In fact, a pseudo-vector on a 3-dimensional manifold is mathematically equivalent to a 2-vector (bivector). It is similar in definition to a 2-form, with the distinction that a 2-vector belongs to the exterior product of the tangent space, $v\\in\\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$, while a 2-form belongs to the exterior product of the cotangent space, $\\omega\\in\\bigwedge^2(T_p^*M)$.

It is because they exhibit exotic behaviors under space inversion transformations. However, if we consider them as the exterior product of two vectors, all the peculiar behaviors can be explained. Specifically, as shown in the figure below, under a space inversion transformation, the magnetic field reverses its direction. It’s similar to you moving in one direction, but the reflection of you in the mirror moves in the opposite direction, which is a spooky and paranormal event. The magnetic field is a bivector. If you consider it as a vector, you will encounter this spooky phenomenon in the picture: the magnetic field takes a look in the mirror and finds its head turned into feet. In fact, the magnetic field at point $p$ is not a vector but a bivector, denoted as $B|_p\\in (T_pM)\\wedge (T_pM)$. Its basis consists of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y},\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z},\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. So, there is no paranormal event happening. Under a space inversion transformation, both vectors corresponding to the magnetic field actually point in the correct directions. It’s just that humans insist on using the right-hand rule and treat a bivector as a vector, which leads to the appearance of this strange phenomenon. Although bivectors are well-defined in mathematics, we still want to ask the question: How do we visualize a bivector? The answer is: We can represent a bivector as an oriented surface element. Different-shaped surface elements that are parallel to each other and have the same area represent the same bivector. In other words, the same bivector can be depicted in infinitely many ways, as long as they are parallel, have the same area, and have the same orientation. Parallel surface elements with the same area and orientation represent the same bivector. In practice, treating a bivector as a vector using the right-hand rule is only applicable in three-dimensional manifolds. This is because only in three-dimensional manifolds does three minus two exactly equal one. In four-dimensional manifolds, since four minus two equals two, we can only dualize a bivector into another bivector, not a vector. In five-dimensional manifolds, a bivector can be dualized into a trivector, and so on. In an n-dimensional manifold, a bivector can be dualized into an (n-2)-vector.

Its basis consists of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y},\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, involving a time dimension. The reason it doesn’t appear as a “pseudo-vector” is that we only consider space inversion transformations rather than time inversion transformations. If we consider the electromagnetic 2-form in the cotangent bundle (using natural units): $$ \\begin{aligned} F\u0026=E_x\\mathrm{d}t\\wedge\\mathrm{d}x+E_y\\mathrm{d}t\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y+E_z\\mathrm{d}t\\wedge\\mathrm{d}z \\\\ \u0026+B_x \\mathrm{d}y\\wedge\\mathrm{d}z + B_y \\mathrm{d}z\\wedge\\mathrm{d}x + B_z\\mathrm{d}x\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y \\end{aligned} $$ Since we can raise or lower the indices of a tensor with the help of a metric tensor, we can also write a $(2,0)$-type electromagnetic tensor with the basis formed by the exterior product of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$. However, for now, let’s adopt the $(0,2)$-type antisymmetric tensor (differential form) because it allows us to utilize the symbol $\\mathrm{d}$ for the exterior derivative. Now, let’s consider the current 1-form: $J=-\\rho\\mathrm{d}t+J_x\\mathrm{d}x+J_y\\mathrm{d}y+J_z\\mathrm{d}z$. Thus, under the Minkowski metric $\\text{diag}(-1,1,1,1)$, Maxwell’s equations can be expressed in a concise form: $$ \\left\\{\\quad \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{d}F\u0026=0 \\\\ \\star \\, \\mathrm{d}\\star F \u0026= J \\end{aligned} \\right. $$ Here, $\\star$ represents the Hodge star operator (also known as Hodge duality). As can be seen, in the language of exterior algebra, the electromagnetic field is a 2-vector or a 2-form, rather than a vector or a 1-form. The current is indeed a vector (or a 1-form), though.
