[{"categories":["Quantum Information"],"content":"Does the idle light passing through the optical fiber amplifier still entangle with the signal light, which is produced by SPDC? Let’s consider two extremes: Extreme 1: The gain of the amplifier is equal to 1, that is, there is no gain at all. In this case, the amplifier acts as if it has done nothing and is an identity channel. So, of course, the entanglement will still be maintained. (Actually, it’s not necessarily the case. Even if the gain is zero, additional noise may be introduced, but we ignore it here for now). Extreme 2: The gain of the amplifier is very large. Assuming that entanglement can be maintained at this point, we can obtain macroscopic Schrödinger cat states. But such states are basically unattainable experimentally because they have already decohered. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as bright squeezed states). So, between these two extremes, we can say that when the gain is relatively small, entanglement can be maintained, but when the gain is relatively large (actually, the “relatively large” magnitude estimate is about ~10, referring to the N00N state), entanglement will disappear due to noise or decoherence. Next, let’s discuss two cases separately, based on the $\\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear parametric amplifier and the stimulated emission amplifier.

If PDC is used for optical amplification, it can also be called OPA, optical parametric amplification. Note that PDC here should be distinguished from SPDC, spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Assuming that the pump for both SPDC and OPA is strong enough, then their Hamiltonians can be written as: $H_\\text{SPDC}=\\mathrm{i}\\hbar(\\hat{a}^\\dag \\hat{b}^\\dag - \\hat{a} \\hat{b})$ $H_\\text{OPA} = \\mathrm{i}\\hbar(\\hat{b}^\\dag \\hat{c}^\\dag -\\hat{b}\\hat{c})$ where $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$ represent the annihilation operators on the idler and signal modes of SPDC, and $\\hat{b}$ and $\\hat{c}$ represent the annihilation operators on the signal and idler modes of OPA. So the final quantum state is: $|\\Psi\\rangle = \\exp[\\mathrm{i}g_\\text{2}H_\\text{OPA} /\\hbar]\\exp[\\mathrm{i}g_\\text{1}H_\\text{SPDC}/\\hbar] |0,0,0\\rangle_{abc}$ where $g_1$ is the logarithm of the gain of SPDC, and $g_2$ is the logarithm of the gain of OPA. Finally, just trace out the idler of OPA: $\\rho=\\operatorname{tr}_c[|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|]$ The specific calculations might not be straightforward. If there are quantum information theorists interested in helping with the calculation, it would be great. Also, consider what entanglement measure to use. The PPT criterion definitely cannot be used because these are two modes, not two qubits. However, we can guess the calculation process: blindly guess that the process of passing through OPA and tracing out the OPA idler is equivalent to a dephasing channel. Then we approximate the SPDC state in the low-gain limit as a Bell state. At this point, the degree of entanglement depends directly on the strength of dephasing, which is positively correlated with the gain of OPA, and likely proportional to the gain, i.e., $\\exp(g_2)$. Considering a 20 dB gain, the degree of entanglement will decrease by $10^{20/10} = 100$ times. So after some “calculation”, we conclude: the larger the gain of OPA, the smaller the degree of entanglement.

But the most commonly used EDFA is not based on $\\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity, but on stimulated emission amplification, similar to the principle of lasers. At this point, the Hamiltonian is much more complicated than OPA because it involves atoms. Let’s first consider a single-mode optical field: $H = \\hbar\\omega a^\\dag a + \\sum_j \\hbar \\omega_a \\sigma^+_j \\sigma^-_j + \\hbar \\Omega \\sum_j (\\sigma^+_j a -\\sigma_j^- a^\\dag)$ where $\\omega$ is the frequency of the optical field, $\\omega_a$ is the energy level difference of the atom, $\\sigma^{\\pm}$ is the raising and lowering operators of the atomic levels, $\\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency. This is actually the Hamiltonian of the Tavis-Cummings model. There is no general analytical solution for this thing, so we can only do perturbation approximations. After some perturbation calculations [1], we can obtain: $(\\Delta X)^2 = G (\\Delta X_{0})^2 + (2 n_{\\text{sp}}-1)(G-1) \\frac{1}{4}$ where $X$ is any quadrature of the optical field, which can be understood as the real or imaginary part of the electric field intensity. $G$ is the gain. $n_\\text{sp} = \\frac{N_2}{N_2-N_1}$ represents the degree of population inversion. The larger $n_\\text{sp}$, the lower the inversion degree, and the smaller $n_\\text{sp}$, the higher the inversion degree, with a minimum of 1. It can be seen that EDFA not only amplifies the noise of the input signal by a factor of $G$, but also introduces additional noise from vacuum fields, and amplifies the noise from vacuum fields by $(2 n_{\\text{sp}}-1)(G-1)$ times. This is the Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE), the noise amplified by spontaneous emission. See the figure below: Wigner representation of the quantum state after passing through EDFA. Image source [1] The above is about dynamics. How do these dynamics affect entanglement? It is well known that the signal and idler obtained by SPDC form an entangled state: $|\\Psi\\rangle_\\text{SPDC} \\approx |\\text{vac}\\rangle + \\lambda \\int \\mathrm{d}\\omega_s \\mathrm{d}\\omega_i f(\\omega_s,\\omega_i)a^\\dag_s(\\omega_s) a^\\dag_i(\\omega_i) |\\text{vac}\\rangle$, where $f(\\omega_s,\\omega_i)$ is the joint frequency distribution, depending on phase matching conditions and pump linewidth (momentum conservation and energy conservation conditions). $|\\text{vac}\\rangle$ represents the vacuum state on all modes, and $\\lambda \\ll 1$ represents the average number of photons of SPDC in the low gain limit, which is commonly used in experiments. $f(\\omega_s,\\omega_i)$ is usually inseparable, that is, it cannot be written as $f(\\omega_s,\\omega_i) = f_s(\\omega_s) f_i(\\omega_i)$. Therefore, the signal and idler modes of SPDC show frequency entanglement. Since it is frequency entangled, we need to consider the multi-mode situation. For simplicity, let’s consider only two frequency modes $\\omega = \\mu,\\nu$. Then the SPDC state can be written as: $|\\text{vac}\\rangle + \\lambda (|1\\rangle \\otimes |0\\rangle \\otimes |0\\rangle \\otimes |1\\rangle+ |0\\rangle \\otimes |1\\rangle \\otimes |1\\rangle \\otimes |0\\rangle)$ where from left to right, the four modes are respectively the $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ frequency modes of the signal and the $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ frequency modes of the idler.

According to special relativity, there is no interaction between events at spacelike separation. The mainstream view in academia is to consider quantum states and measurement bases together as reality, known as contextuality. Nonlocality is a corollary of contextuality. Body: Discussing the “speed” of quantum entanglement is meaningless. If the distance between two measurement events a and b is spacelike, then a is neither in the past nor in the future of b. This is because, in special relativity, if the distance between a and b is spacelike, whether a is in the past or future of b depends on the observer’s frame of reference. Therefore, there is no definite time sequence between a and b, and thus no causal relationship. In this case, we should say: the measurement results of a and b exhibit nonlocal correlations, rather than saying that the measurement result of a affects the measurement result of b, or vice versa. See the diagram below: Source [1], although it's from an MDPI journal, this diagram is very good In the above diagram, the two events a and b are outside each other’s light cone, so there is no interaction between them. What really exists is the correlation between their measurement results. Correlation is not hard to understand because they both originate from a Bell pair. What is truly difficult to understand is: when you change the measurement basis (refer to various Bell test experiments), you will find that this correlation also depends on the measurement basis, i.e., it changes with the measurement basis. This leads to at least one of the following conclusions: The quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ itself is incomplete and cannot fully describe reality. Only when the measurement basis $\\mathsf{E}$ is determined, $(|\\psi\\rangle,\\mathsf{E})$ is complete. This is called contextuality, meaning reality only exists when the measurement basis is determined, and does not exist before that. In this case, nonlocality is a corollary of contextuality. If you insist that local and non-contextual reality exists and propose a local and non-contextual hidden variable theory, then you must accept negative probabilities in this theory. In this case, your theory cannot be described by classical probability theory but must use non-Kolmogorov probability theory. If you believe that negative probabilities themselves violate reality, then refer back to the first point. The contextuality mentioned in the first point is currently mainstream in academia. There are more and more papers studying contextuality, which should be considered a small trend in quantum information research. The core idea of contextuality is: quantum reality only exists when the measuring instrument is given. Some people also call this sub-reality or contextual reality. Therefore, I personally think that the translation of contextuality is not very good and should be called “context dependence.” The “context” here refers to the measuring instrument. Unfortunately, a significant number of scholars still do not understand contextuality, and it is not introduced in most standard textbooks, let alone in popular science and mass culture. But this is understandable: contextuality was proposed in the 1990s, 30 years later than Bell’s theorem, and is somewhat at the forefront of academia. In summary: “spooky action at a distance (superluminal)” is an outdated view. According to special relativity, there is no interaction between events at spacelike separation. The mainstream view in academia is to consider quantum states and measurement bases together as reality, known as contextuality. Nonlocality is a corollary of contextuality.

Measurement Model The overall idea of this section is as follows: Consider a system to be measured, with its Hilbert space being $\\mathcal{H}$ and state $\\rho$.

Quantum-Classical Transition Finally, you may wonder: what state does the probe collapse to after measurement? This is a very interesting question. Because we use PVM $\\mathsf{Q}$ to measure the position of the instrument probe, it seems that the probe state should collapse to a delta function. In this way, the above analysis seems to simply change one problem into another problem. That is: the problem of how the quantum state of the system to be measured collapses is transformed into the problem of how the probe state collapses. But in practice, our instrument is a macroscopic classical system, not a quantum system, so the actual situation is more complicated. If you understand some knowledge about POVM and quantum measurement models, you will know: (non-PVM) POVM itself can only provide the probability of measurement results. What the collapsed state is specific to can only be given by a measurement model, and this measurement model will inevitably involve an ancillary system $\\mathcal{K}$. If you want to know the quantum state of $\\mathcal{K}$, you have to measure the system $\\mathcal{K}$ with another system $\\mathcal{M}$, and so on. This cyclical process is the process of transition from quantum to classical. The transition from quantum to classical involves the measurement problem, which is an unresolved problem in quantum mechanics, and I don’t want to discuss it too much here. Interested readers can search the literature for further study. In this way, the measurement model seems to be similar to decoherence, both of which seem to solve the measurement problem, but in fact do not. Nevertheless, they still provide us with a lot of insight. Of course, the above only talks about the problem of observable quantities with continuous spectra. For observable quantities with discrete spectra, PVM is easily implemented in experiments. PVM can directly give the collapsed state after measurement, and this state has good properties and does not have the pathological properties of delta functions.

By diagonalizing, we obtain the eigenvectors $a^{\\pm} = x \\pm \\mathrm{i} p$, and the derivatives of $a^{\\pm}$ only depend on themselves: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}a^{\\pm}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mp \\mathrm{i} \\omega a^{\\pm}, \\quad a^{\\pm} = a_0^{\\pm} \\exp (\\mp \\mathrm{i} \\omega t)$ In this procedure, $a^{+}$ and $a^{-}$, when quantized, become the annihilation and creation operators. Note that $a^{+} \\rightarrow \\hat{a}, \\quad a^{-} \\rightarrow \\hat{a}^\\dag$, then $[\\hat{a}, \\hat{a}^\\dag] = [\\hat{x} + \\mathrm{i}\\hat{p}, \\hat{x} - \\mathrm{i}\\hat{p}] = -\\mathrm{i}[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = 1$. The rest of the story is well known. The multimode case is also simple. Each time we decouple an eigenvector, we call it a mode, corresponding to the creation and annihilation operators for that mode. This is how quasiparticles (like phonons) originate. In classical mechanics, $a^{+}$ and $a^{-}$ are just techniques extended to the complex domain for convenience in solving problems. In quantum mechanics, however, they have tangible physical meanings. Hence, quantum mechanics cannot do without complex numbers.

Consider the interaction between a two-level system and a single-mode light field, where the frequency of the light field equals the energy level difference. The two-level system initially starts in the excited state $|e\\rangle$, and the light field is in the vacuum state $|0\\rangle$. According to the Jaynes-Cummings model, even if the light field is in the vacuum state, spontaneous emission will occur. After a short period, the quantum state evolves from $|e,0\\rangle$ to: $|\\psi\\rangle = a |e,0\\rangle + b |g,1\\rangle$ where $|g,1\\rangle$ represents the two-level system in the ground state, and the coupled light field mode contains one photon, which is the spontaneously emitted photon. Now consider $N$ two-level systems in the excited state, which are not coupled with each other but only with the light field. The initial spontaneously emitted photon induces stimulated emission in other two-level systems, so the overall quantum state can be written as: $|\\Psi\\rangle = C|\\psi\\rangle^{\\otimes N} = C\\sum_k \\sum_m\\mathcal{P}_m[|e,0\\rangle^{\\otimes (N-k)} \\otimes |g,1\\rangle^{\\otimes k}]$ where $C$ is a normalization constant to be determined, and $\\mathcal{P}_m$ denotes all possible permutations of $|e,0\\rangle^{\\otimes (N-k)} \\otimes |g,1\\rangle^{\\otimes k}$, with a total of $\\frac{N!}{(N-k)!,k!}$ permutations. Note that we have not yet used the Fock space (i.e., we haven’t symmetrized for identical bosons). This step is quite informal, and possibly incorrect, because it doesn’t explain why stimulated emission means that the overall quantum state is the tensor product of the spontaneous emission state $|\\psi\\rangle = a |e,0\\rangle + b |g,1\\rangle$. However, we will see later that it gives the correct result. Therefore, this derivation must contain some insight that I haven’t yet identified. The quantum state of the light field is obtained by tracing out the quantum state of the two-level systems: $\\rho = \\operatorname{Tr}_{\\text{a}}[|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|] = C^2 \\sum_k |a^{N-k}b^k|^2 \\sum_m\\mathcal{P}_m[(|0\\rangle\\langle 0|)^{\\otimes (N-k)} \\otimes (|1\\rangle\\langle 1|)^{\\otimes k}]$ Now we symmetrize the tensor product of identical particles and map it to Fock space, which is well-known as $|1\\rangle ^{\\otimes k} \\rightarrow \\sqrt{k!} |k\\rangle$, so the above equation becomes $\\rho = C^2 \\sum_k |a^{N-k}b^k|^2 \\left(\\frac{N!}{(N-k)!,k!}\\right)^2 k! |k\\rangle\\langle k|$ When $k \\ll N$, $\\frac{N!}{(N-k)!} \\sim \\left(\\frac{N}{e}\\right)^k$. Let $\\alpha = \\frac{b}{a} \\cdot \\frac{N}{e}$, then the above equation can be written as: $\\rho = C^2 a^N \\sum_k \\frac{|\\alpha|^{2k}}{k!} |k\\rangle\\langle k|$ Normalizing it, we get: $\\rho = e^{-|\\alpha|^2} \\sum_k \\frac{|\\alpha|^{2k}}{k!} |k\\rangle\\langle k|$ This is a Poisson distribution with an average particle number of $|\\alpha|^2$. In the coherent state representation, it can be written as: $\\rho = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{2\\pi} |\\alpha e^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta}\\rangle \\langle \\alpha e^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta}|$ It is thus a phase-randomized coherent state. The coherent state $|\\alpha\\rangle$ corresponds to a classical electromagnetic wave with very well-defined amplitude and phase, but here its phase is integrated from $0$ to $2\\pi$. This represents our ignorance of the phase information, which fundamentally comes from our ignorance of the microscopic state of the two-level systems (the gain medium). Therefore, this $\\rho = \\rho_{\\text{epistemic}}$ is an epistemic quantum state. From the perspective of an ontic quantum state, the quantum state of the system should collapse to a state with a definite phase $\\rho_{\\text{ontic}} = |\\alpha\\rangle$, but we cannot know which phase it is. This is because, at optical frequencies $\\sim 10^{15} \\text{Hz}$, humans cannot observe the absolute phase. However, relative phase can be observed, so we can still observe interference phenomena.

Compared to spin angular momentum (i.e., polarization, SAM) which can only take $\\pm \\hbar$, orbital angular momentum can take any integer multiple of $\\hbar$. Such orbital angular momentum can be carried by helical wavefronts. You might be surprised: did people only discover this in 1992? In fact, helical wavefronts had been studied before 1992; photons carrying angular momentum greater than $\\hbar$ had already been predicted by atomic physics (though they originate from higher-order transition processes, which do not satisfy the selection rules and thus have very low probabilities, making them practically unobservable in experiments). It wasn’t until 1992 that Allen et al. pointed out that light beams with helical wavefronts carry quantized orbital angular momentum. From 1992 to 2001, research on OAM was mostly in the domain of macroscopic electromagnetic waves (coherent states of a large number of photons). In a paper in 2001 [2] by Nobel laureate Zeilinger’s group, the orbital angular momentum and its entanglement of single photons were studied for the first time. Since then, OAM has also gained the interest of researchers in quantum information and quantum optics. One potential application of OAM in quantum information is quantum precision measurement, as its $e^{\\mathrm{i}l\\varphi}$ factor helps to increase the precision of angle measurements by a factor of $l$. Additionally, SAM and OAM can interact through a q-plate, which is beneficial for quantum information processing. OAM also has many other classical applications [3], which will not be elaborated here.

Hermite-Gaussian (HG) Beams Before introducing Laguerre-Gaussian beams that carry orbital angular momentum, it is best to introduce Hermite-Gaussian beams. Why introduce Gaussian beams? Because the electromagnetic waves obtainable in experiments are not ideal plane waves but Gaussian beams output by lasers. Waist width w0, Rayleigh length zR, and divergence angle theta of a Gaussian beam, image source Wikipedia The electric field amplitude of a common Hermite-Gaussian beam is as follows: $\\begin{aligned} E_{m,n}(x,y,z) = \u0026 ,E_0 \\color{blue}{ \\frac{w_0}{w(z)}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{w(z)^2}\\right] } \\times \\\\ \u0026 \\color{green}{\\exp\\left[-\\mathrm{i}\\frac{k(x^2+y^2)}{2 R(z)}\\right]} \\color{orange}{\\exp\\left[\\mathrm{i}\\psi(z)\\right]} \\color{gray}{\\exp[-\\mathrm{i}kz]} \\times \\\\ \u0026 \\color{red}{H_m\\left[\\sqrt{2}\\frac{x}{w(z)}\\right]H_n\\left[\\sqrt{2}\\frac{y}{w(z)}\\right]} \\end{aligned} $ where: $\\color{blue}{w(z) = w_0 \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{z}{z_R}\\right)^2}}$ represents the beam width at $z$, $z_R = \\pi\\frac{w_0^2}{\\lambda}$ is the Rayleigh length, defined as the $z$ value at which the beam width diverges to $\\sqrt{2}$ times the waist width. $\\color{green}{R(z) = \\frac{z^2 + z_R^2}{z}}$ represents the curvature radius of the wavefront at $z$. $\\color{orange}{\\psi(z)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{z}{z_R}\\right)}$ represents the Gouy phase shift. There is an extra phase shift of $\\pi$ from negative infinity to positive infinity. $\\color{red}{H_m(t)}$ is the $m$-th order Hermite polynomial. These are also the energy eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator. When $m,n$ are both zero, it degenerates to the fundamental Gaussian beam. Most lasers output fundamental Gaussian beams. As can be seen, remembering the Gaussian beam is not difficult, just remember three characteristics: $\\color{blue}{\\text{waist divergence}}$, $\\color{green}{\\text{curvature radius}}$, $\\color{orange}{\\text{Gouy phase shift}}$. Another useful quantity is the divergence angle. From $\\color{blue}{w(z) = w_0 \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{z}{z_R}\\right)^2}}$, it can be seen that the tangent value of the divergence angle is $\\tan \\theta=\\frac{w_0}{z_R}$, so $w_0 \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi}$. The shape of a Gaussian beam is completely determined by any two of the wavelength, waist radius, and divergence angle. The relationship between these three is given by $w_0 \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi}$. $E_{m,n}(x,y,z)$ only represents the amplitude of the electric field and does not include polarization information. Adding polarization information is easy: if it is $x$-direction polarized, simply multiply $E_{m,n}(x,y,z)$ by the unit vector in the $x$ direction $\\hat{x}$. If it is circularly polarized, multiply by $\\hat{x} \\pm \\mathrm{i}\\hat{y}$. Note that $E_{m,n}(x,y,z)$ is a complex number. For classical electromagnetic waves, the real part of this is the actual electric field amplitude. For quantum electromagnetic waves, we can assign an annihilation operator to this mode, which is a linear combination of plane wave annihilation operators, with coefficients obtainable by Fourier analysis.

Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) Beams In the solutions of the two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, besides the linear vibrations represented by Hermite polynomials, there are rotational motions represented by Laguerre polynomials.

Manipulating Spin Angular Momentum and Orbital Angular Momentum with a Q-Plate A q-plate, proposed in 2006 [4], is essentially a half-wave plate with its optical axis varying with position, and the angle $\\alpha$ of the optical axis satisfies $\\alpha(r,\\varphi) = q \\varphi + \\alpha_0$.

Q-plates are currently the most commonly used method for preparing OAM states in experiments. Of course, spatial light modulators (SLM) can also be used. One reason why OAM attracts the interest of quantum information researchers is that its Hilbert space dimension, like that of a harmonic oscillator, is infinite, unlike polarization (SAM), which only has two states. The interaction between SAM and OAM leads to a straightforward idea: using SAM and OAM to make a CNOT gate, where SAM is the control bit and OAM is the target bit. There are many similar experiments, which are not listed here.

Before opening the boxes, you cannot know what is inside. Alice and Bob each take a box and move to distant locations. When Alice opens her box, she instantly knows what is in Bob’s box far away. This example must be wrong… because it doesn’t involve quantum mechanics at all. Indeed, this example demonstrates classical correlation, not quantum entanglement. Let pizza be $|0\\rangle$ and burger be $|1\\rangle$, then in the above example, the state of the system is $\\rho_{\\text{classical correlation}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( |01\\rangle\\langle 01| + |10\\rangle\\langle 10| \\right)$ In matrix form, it is: $\\rho_{\\text{classical correlation}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\frac{1}{2} \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 \\frac{1}{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ However, true quantum entanglement should be as follows: $\\rho_{\\text{quantum entanglement}} = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi | = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( |01\\rangle\\langle 01| + |10\\rangle\\langle 10| + |01\\rangle\\langle 10| + |10\\rangle\\langle 01 | \\right)$ Where $|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|01\\rangle + |10 \\rangle)$ In matrix form, it is: $\\rho_{\\text{quantum entanglement}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\frac{1}{2} \u0026 \\frac{1}{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\frac{1}{2} \u0026 \\frac{1}{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ As you can see, true quantum entanglement has off-diagonal terms. These off-diagonal terms are also called coherences. Similarly, when the above quantum entangled state decoheres, classical correlation is obtained. In other words, classical correlation is the result of the decoherence of quantum entanglement. Decoherence is also an interpretation of the quantum measurement problem: when a system entangles with the environment, if we examine the partial trace of the system, we find that the system’s state is decohered. In this way, quantum entanglement becomes classical correlation, and the density matrix only retains the diagonal terms. But decoherence cannot explain the problem of wavefunction collapse. Because the following process is still caused by the collapse of the overall wavefunction of the system and the environment. $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 \\frac{1}{2} \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 \\frac{1}{2} \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\xrightarrow{\\text{collapse}} \\begin{cases} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 1 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \u0026 \\text{with }\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ probability} \\\\ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 1 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \u0026 \\text{with }\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ probability} \\end{cases}$ This step cannot be explained by decoherence. Therefore, the measurement problem has not yet been resolved. This is also understandable: decoherence itself is still a unitary evolution process, while wavefunction collapse is non-unitary. So, we can only temporarily accept that wavefunction collapse is an axiom in modern quantum mechanics, rather than a theorem that can be derived. This leads to a completeness problem: we cannot determine through quantum mechanics alone whether a process should be a unitary evolution or a non-unitary collapse process. This problem is also called the Heisenberg cut, which is how to find such a “cut” so that below it the system evolves normally, while above it the system collapses. Of course, since our existing measuring instruments are systems with a large number of particles, we don’t need to worry about this problem—we are very certain that our measurements will induce the collapse of the system.

From the equation $p_k = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\Pi_k]$, you can see that if $\\rho$ has $n$ degrees of freedom, we need at least $n$ measurement operators, and they must be “independent of each other.” This condition is known as tomographical completeness or informational completeness. Why is it called “Tomography”? State tomography is called “tomography” because the tomography of continuous-variable photon states is really similar to the CT (Computed Tomography) in hospitals. CT reconstructs a 3D image from projection images from various angles, while the tomography of continuous-variable photon states reconstructs the Wigner function from projection images at various angles. The latter is a kind of “two-dimensional image.” It’s also understandable with discrete variables because (von Neumann) measurement is essentially projection, and tomography is reconstructing the original quantum state from the measured projections. In short, tomography is named because it is the process of reconstructing the whole from projections.

They correspond to the X, Y, Z axes on the Bloch sphere, which are equivalent to measuring the x, y, and z components of the Bloch vector. However, the issue is that in experiments, we do not directly measure probabilities but rather counts. If we want to know the probability $p_Z = \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho (\\mathbb{I} + Z)/2] = \\langle0|\\rho|0\\rangle$, we must use counts $p_Z = \\frac{N_Z}{N_Z + N_{-Z}}$, while measuring $N_{-Z}$ requires another measurement operator $(\\mathbb{I} - Z)/2$. In general, since we measure counts and require normalization, the actual number of measurement operators required is always one more than the theoretical requirement. And the degrees of freedom for the density operator of $N$ qubits is $4^n - 1$, and adding one precisely equals $4^n$. For $n = 1$, we need four measurement operators. This was also the method adopted by the earliest article on photon state tomography[1]. Okay, let’s dive deeper into the state tomography of a single qubit, which will help us expand to multiple qubits later. A qubit’s density operator is $\\rho = \\frac{\\mathbb{I} + xX + yY + zZ}{2}$.

Observant readers might notice that the density operator must be positive definite, but the above solution process doesn’t guarantee positive definiteness. In fact, following the above steps, it is entirely possible to derive non-positive-definite density operators. In other words, the result might be “non-physical.” This is because experimental data is subject to error, which can lead to non-physical results under certain conditions. Note, this is not due to errors caused by an imperfect experimental system but by quantum statistical errors, or fluctuations. For example, for coherent states, the count distribution is Poissonian, with variance equal to the mean. When time is limited, and not much data can be collected, the relative error $\\frac{\\Delta N}{N} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$ might be quite high. Some might suggest: “What if we add a constraint to ensure positive definiteness?” In this example, as long as we require $|x|, |y|, |z| \\leq 1$, positive definiteness can be guaranteed. But here’s the problem: Adding constraints leads to no solution when faced with errors. Okay, given that no solution is caused by errors, we can resort to a different approach, converting the problem from [solving equations] to [fitting]. What is fitting? We know that two points determine a straight line. However, if the data points themselves have large errors, we might need many points, which almost certainly do not lie on a single straight line. In this case, there’s no solution for the straight-line equation. Even with no solution, we can fit! Using the least-squares method! So where does the least-squares method come from? The answer is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The basic idea behind MLE is to find a straight line (among many) that is most likely to generate the measured points. The specific implementation involves setting a likelihood function with straight-line parameters as independent variables, where the function value represents the probability of measuring these results with the given straight-line parameters. The whole problem then becomes an optimization problem: Find the maximum value of the likelihood function and its corresponding straight-line parameters. In many cases, experimental errors are assumed to follow a normal distribution, so the likelihood function is exponential in the form $L = e^{-\\mathcal{L}}$. By taking the logarithm of the likelihood function and inverting it, we get a new likelihood function, $\\mathcal{L}$, and the optimization problem becomes finding the minimum value of the new likelihood function. This new likelihood function can generally be interpreted as “given this straight line, the total error between the theoretical and actual measurements.” All of these ideas can be directly applied to our state tomography. We can set a likelihood function with the degrees of freedom for the positive-definite matrix $\\rho(x,y,z)$, where the function value is the probability of measuring the observed results given quantum state $\\rho$. Let’s convert these ideas into an algorithm: Define a valid density operator $\\rho(x,y,z) = \\frac{\\mathbb{I} + xX + yY + zZ}{2}$, with $|x|, |y|, |z| \\leq 1$. Define the likelihood function as the probability of measuring the observed results, given quantum state $\\rho$: $ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{L}(x,y,z) \u0026= P(N_1 = n_1, N_2 = n_2, \\ldots) \\\\ \u0026= \\prod_k \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(n_k - \\hat{n}_k)^2}{2\\hat{n}_k}\\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\prod_k \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(n_k - N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\Pi_k])^2}{2N \\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho \\Pi_k]}\\right] \\end{aligned} $ In this case, we use the continuous normal distribution instead of the discrete Poisson distribution because when counts are large (typically a few hundred to a few thousand), the normal distribution can closely approximate the Poisson distribution. More importantly, the likelihood function of the normal distribution provides an unbiased estimate, just as effective as the Poisson ","date":"2024-04-22","objectID":"/state_tomography/:3:0","tags":["Quantum Optics"],"title":"Quantum state tomography - a beginner's guide","uri":"/state_tomography/"},{"categories":["Quantum Information"],"content":"State tomography of multiple qubits The density matrix of n qubits has $4^n -1$ degrees of freedom.

The reason we care about continuous variables is that photons are fundamentally harmonic oscillators, not two-level systems. Considering the former is more natural and aligns better with the nature of photons. Indeed, the classical electromagnetic waves in our daily life are a type of continuous-variable photonic state (coherent state). A single-mode continuous-variable photonic state can be described by quasi-probability distribution functions. There are three such functions: Glauber P-, Husimi Q-, and Wigner functions, referred to as P-, Q-, and W-, respectively. Among them, only the Wigner function’s marginal distributions correspond to actual observable probability distributions, which is why we typically consider the Wigner function. What is the Wigner function? How do we understand the Wigner function? Let’s start from classical electromagnetic waves. We know that single-mode (monochromatic) electromagnetic waves can be described by a point on the complex plane (i.e., using a phasor diagram). Superposition of electromagnetic waves directly corresponds to complex number addition (or vector addition). This so-called phasor representation can be immediately extended to quantum mechanics. For a quantized single-mode classical electromagnetic field, its phasor representation is no longer an infinitesimal point but a circle with a certain size. In fact, it is a Gaussian function on the complex plane, with the standard deviation determined by the uncertainty principle. This Gaussian function is the Wigner function of the classical electromagnetic wave, and its marginal distribution corresponds to the probability distribution of the quadrature field strength (the electric field is also an observable and has uncertainty). The quantum state obtained by quantizing a classical electromagnetic wave is called the Coherent state. For a more general quantum optical field, its Wigner function can have strange shapes and can even take on negative values. However, this does not mean we get negative probabilities—after taking the marginal distribution, we always get a non-negative probability. This is because the area occupied by these negative values is small enough to be smaller than the area allowed by the uncertainty principle, meaning the uncertainty principle ensures that we cannot observe negative probability. Some interesting Wigner functions for photon states. The left image shows a squeezed state, and the right image shows a Schrödinger cat state. State tomography of continuous-variable photon states is completed by measuring quadrature. In this case, all measurement operators have the following form: $\\begin{aligned} \\Pi_\\theta = \\frac{ae^{-i\\theta}+a^\\dag e^{i\\theta}}{2} \\end{aligned}$ This is the so-called “quadrature” (I don’t know the Chinese translation). Conceptually, it projects the entire Wigner function onto a straight line, with this line making an angle $\\theta$ with the x-axis. Quantum state tomography of continuous-variable optical states Quantum information theory tells us that if we want to reconstruct the Wigner function with infinite precision, we need infinitely many values of $\\theta$, which means countless measurement operators. Of course, we don’t need infinite precision, so we only need to take $\\theta$ at some reasonable intervals. For example, taking steps of 0.01 radians from 0 to 2pi. After obtaining the probability density function of the quadrature, we can use the inverse Radon transform to reconstruct the Wigner function. This is similar to the principle used in hospital CT scans. As for how to measure quadratures experimentally, it’s simple: like in radio technology, mix the signal with a local oscillator. This is called homodyne measurement.

For example, differentials are linear, but manifolds are curved, so we need to define something linear within this curvature. This linear thing is the tangent space. As the name suggests, the tangent space is a tangent plane to a curved surface at a certain point. But how do we define it? The curvature here is not embedded in another space but intrinsic to space itself. We cannot find the equation of a tangent plane as in classical analytic geometry. Let’s try a different approach: Firstly, it is linear, which means it is a vector space. A vector space is a group equipped with scalar multiplication. Specifically, its elements (called vectors) satisfy the following properties: (1) Commutativity of vector addition (2) Associativity of vector addition (3) Existence of an identity element for vector addition (similar to zero) (4) Existence of an inverse element for vector addition (similar to the negative number) The above four properties indicate that the vector space is an abelian group with respect to vector addition. (5) Existence of a multiplicative identity for scalar multiplication (6) Associativity of scalar multiplication (7) Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition (8) Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to scalar addition A vector space does not have to be $\\mathbb{R}^n,,\\mathbb{C}^n$, as long as a set is defined with addition and scalar multiplication operations satisfying the above properties, it is a vector space. We can define such a vector space, where the elements are linear maps from a set of smooth functions to the real number field: $v:\\mathcal{F}_M\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ such that (1) $v(\\lambda f+\\mu g)=\\lambda v(f)+\\mu v(g)$ (linearity) (2) $v|_p(f\\cdot g)=f|_p\\cdot v(g)+g|_p\\cdot v(f)$ (Leibniz law) where $\\mathcal{F}_M$ is the set of all smooth functions on the differential manifold $M$. It can be proven that the collection of $v$ forms a vector space. Although this definition seems complicated, it is actually just finding the directional derivative of a function at a certain point. Taking a bivariate function as an example, we can explicitly write out an instance of $v$: $\\left(a\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+b\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\\bigg|_p$ If $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_p,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_p)$ is taken as the basis, then its coordinates are $(a,b)$. This linear space is the tangent space at point $p$ on the manifold, denoted as $T_pM$. All these operations are at a certain point $p$, where each point grows a tangent space. You can imagine that every point on a curved surface grows a tangent plane.

In other words, the differential at a certain point is a cotangent vector. Elements in the dual space (cotangent vectors) are linear functionals that map elements in the original space to a number.

In fact, the differential is the linear mapping characterized by the Jacobian matrix. Below, we explain in detail. For a univariate function, the Jacobian matrix is just the derivative. Although we are used to thinking of derivatives as slopes, let’s change our perspective: If you consider the action of a univariate function as stretching along the number line, then the derivative is the local stretching ratio. The advantage of this perspective is its ease of generalization to multivariate functions. Because, for multivariate functions, you often cannot draw a curve as you would for univariate functions. So, as an alternative method, you can think of a multivariate function as a space being stretched, such as $f: R^2→R^2$. You can imagine that each point in $R^2$ is stretched to a new point by $f$. If you zoom in on this local stretch, it looks like the case of a univariate function—linear—parallel lines are stretched to parallel lines. And what we call the differential is precisely this local linear mapping! The matrix of this linear mapping is the Jacobian matrix.

The Hamiltonian for this process is given by: $H = i\\hbar g,a^\\dag_s a^\\dag_i a_p + h.c.$ where $g$ represents the interaction strength.

We can use the Schmidt number to quantify the degree of spectral correlation, defined as follows: $\\begin{aligned} K= \\frac{1}{\\sum_k\\lambda^4_k} \\end{aligned}$ Example For an uncorrelated joint spectrum, ${\\lambda_k}={1}$ , $K=1$ . For a joint spectrum with two modes and equal coefficients, ${\\lambda_k}={\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}$ , $K=2$ . For a joint spectrum with n modes and equal coefficients, $K=n$ . For a joint spectrum with n modes and coefficients not completely equal to each other, $1\u003cK\u003cn$ . Why do we care about spectral correlation? Because it is closely related to the purity of photons: Property When $r_k$ is small and photons are detected, the quantum state is $|\\Psi_{\\text{conditional}}\\rangle=\\sum_k\\lambda_k|1_k,1_k\\rangle$ . For this quantum state, tracing out one of the two photons (performing partial trace operation), the purity of the remaining photon state is $P=\\frac{1}{K}$ . This is because: $\\begin{aligned} P \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}[\\operatorname{tr}_2[|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|]^2] \\\\ \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\operatorname{tr}_B\\left(\\sum_{k}\\lambda_k \\left| 1_k, 1_k\\right\\rangle\\sum_{l}\\lambda_l \\left\\langle 1_l ,1_l\\right|\\right)^2\\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{k}\\lambda_k^2 \\left|1_k \\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 1_k\\right|\\right)^2\\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\sum_{k}\\left(\\lambda_k^2\\left| 1_k \\right\\rangle\\left\\langle 1_k\\right|\\right)^2\\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\operatorname{tr}\\left[\\sum_{k}\\lambda_k^4 |1_k\\rangle\\langle 1_k|\\right] \\\\ \u0026=\\sum_{k}\\lambda_k^4=\\frac{1}{K} \\end{aligned}$ It can be seen that the purity is inversely proportional to the Schmidt number. That is, the stronger the spectral correlation, the lower the purity of the photons in the frequency domain. This is unfavorable for heralded single-photon sources and various multi-photon interference experiments. For the former, spectral correlation will reduce the frequency-domain indistinguishability of single photons, and for the latter, spectral correlation will reduce the interference contrast.

In this experiment, a beam of light is split into two using a 50:50 beamsplitter, and then each beam is detected separately by two detectors. The correlation of the intensities on both sides is measured as a function of delay, as shown in the figure below: Hanbury Brown and Twiss Experiment The classical normalized g2 is defined as: $\\begin{aligned} g^{(2)}(r_1, r_2; \\tau) \u0026= \\frac{\\langle E^*(r_1, t) E^*(r_2, t + \\tau) E(r_2, t + \\tau) E(r_1, t) \\rangle}{\\langle |E(r_1, t)|^2 \\rangle \\langle |E(r_2, t + \\tau)|^2 \\rangle} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{\\langle I(r_1, t) I(r_2, t + \\tau) \\rangle}{\\langle I(r_1, t) \\rangle \\langle I(r_2, t + \\tau) \\rangle} \\end{aligned}$ where $E$ represents the electric field and $I$ represents the intensity.

Additionally, the creation operator must precede the annihilation operator since the detection of a photon is an annihilation process, unlike the classical case. In classical coherent states $|\\alpha\\rangle$, the annihilation operator $a$ is an eigenstate $a|\\alpha\\rangle = \\alpha|\\alpha\\rangle$, hence the presence or absence of a photon makes no difference. In the case of single-mode, since $E^+ = i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2\\epsilon_0 V}}a$ and $E^- = i\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2\\epsilon_0 V}}a^\\dagger$, the quantum g2 can be simplified to: $\\begin{aligned} g^{(2)}(r_1, r_2, \\tau) \u0026= \\frac{\\langle a^\\dagger(r_1, t) a^\\dagger(r_2, t + \\tau) a(r_2, t + \\tau) a(r_1, t) \\rangle}{\\langle n(r_1, t) \\rangle \\langle n(r_2, t + \\tau) \\rangle} \\end{aligned}$ Therefore, to measure quantum g2, we need to replace intensity detectors with photon detectors, and these photon detectors should be capable of distinguishing photon numbers. However, the problem arises because currently available single-photon detectors that can distinguish photon numbers are not very practical: TES detectors have long recovery times; schemes for Demultiplexing in space and time only offer pseudo-photon number resolution; and SNSPDs are expensive, require low temperatures, and their multi-photon efficiency may not be very high.

Comment: “Cannot distinguish photon numbers” means they can only differentiate between “no photons” and “one or more photons.” Common APD detectors cannot distinguish photon numbers. The method is simple: just make sure the quantum efficiency of the NPNR-SPD is low enough! Quantum efficiency $\\eta$ refers to the probability that the detector can detect a photon given that a photon enters it. Conversely, the probability of the photon being “lost” is $1 - \\eta$. At first, it seemed strange to me why lower efficiency is better. But with a little thought, the principle becomes clear: When the efficiency is low enough, the probability that $k$ photons are not all lost is $1 - (1 - \\eta)^k \\approx k\\eta$. In other words, the probability of the NPNR-SPD detecting a photon is proportional to $k$. Thus, we achieve “photon number resolution” indirectly through “low efficiency”. The following is a formal (boring) mathematical derivation, which can be skipped: [Derivation equations] Measuring g2 has several uses. Besides the common textbook distinctions of [super-Poissonian statistics/Poissonian statistics/sub-Poissonian statistics] and [photon bunching/antibunching], there is an unexpected application: measuring spectral correlations of photons, which we will discuss in the next part.

In this case, $E^+ = i\\sum_k\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_k}{2\\epsilon_0 V}}a_k$, $E^+$ is no longer proportional to $a$, but has a frequency dependence: $E^+_k \\propto \\sqrt{\\omega_k}a_k$.

By performing spectral decomposition on the self-adjoint operator corresponding to the observable, denoted as $ O = \\sum_i \\lambda_i |\\varphi_i\\rangle\\langle\\varphi_i| $, we obtain these projection operators $ |\\varphi_i\\rangle\\langle\\varphi_i| $. This part is well-known to students who have studied elementary quantum mechanics. Besides the Von Neumann measurement, there is a more general type of measurement called Generalized Measurements or Positive Operator Valued Measures (POVMs). Generalized Measurements (POVMs) Definition: POVM A POVM is a mapping $ \\mathsf{E}: X \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}) $, satisfying $ \\mathsf{E}(x) \\ge 0, \\quad \\forall x \\in X $ $ \\sum_ {x \\in X} \\mathsf{E}(x) = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{H}} $ where $ X $ represents the set of possible measurement outcomes, and $ \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}) $ represents the set of all bounded operators on $ \\mathcal{H} $. Born’s Rule The probability of obtaining result $ x $ when measuring a quantum state $ \\rho $ with a POVM $ \\mathsf{E} $ is given by $ p_{\\rho}^{\\mathsf{E}}(x) = \\operatorname{tr}[\\rho \\mathsf{E}(x)] $. When I first encountered POVMs, I was not clear about how they are implemented. This is because traditional measurements involve projection operators satisfying $ \\mathsf{E}(x)^2 = \\mathsf{E}(x), \\quad \\forall x \\in X $. However, general POVMs do not satisfy this condition. In fact, traditional projection measurements, also known as PVMs (Projection Valued Measures), are a special type of POVM. PVMs are to POVMs what pure states are to mixed states. In other words, a POVM is a statistical mixture of PVMs, just as a mixed state is a statistical mixture of pure states. Implementing POVMs So, how do we implement POVMs? We can actually use PVMs and composite systems to implement POVMs. Consider a system with a Hilbert space $ \\mathcal{H} $ and a state $ \\rho $. Next, we couple system $ \\mathcal{H} $ with another system $ \\mathcal{K} $. Suppose the initial state of system $ \\mathcal{K} $ is $ \\sigma $. Then, the initial state of the composite system is $ \\rho \\otimes \\sigma $ in $ \\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{K} $. After that, we let the composite system evolve for a period of time, resulting in the system’s state becoming $ U(\\rho \\otimes \\sigma) U^\\dag $. Finally, we perform a PVM $ \\mathsf{Z} $ measurement on subsystem $ \\mathcal{K} $. According to Born’s rule, the probability of obtaining result $ x $ is $ \\operatorname{tr}[U(\\rho\\otimes \\sigma) U^\\dag(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{H}}\\otimes \\mathsf{Z}(x))] $. Thus, we have implemented a POVM $ \\mathsf{E} $ such that $ \\operatorname{tr}[\\rho \\mathsf{E}(x)] = \\operatorname{tr}[U(\\rho\\otimes \\sigma) U^\\dag(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{H}}\\otimes \\mathsf{Z}(x))] $. Measurement Model Let’s summarize the physical objects involved in implementing POVMs: the ancilla system $ \\mathcal{K} $, the initial state $ \\sigma $ of system $ \\mathcal{K} $, the evolution $ U $ of the composite system, and the projection measurement $ \\mathsf{Z} $ on the ancilla system. These physical objects together realize a POVM measurement. So, we can define $ \\mathfrak{M} = (\\mathcal{K},\\sigma,U,\\mathsf{Z}) $ as a Measurement Model. In actual experiments, the ancilla system $ \\mathcal{K} $ can be considered as a probe of the instrument, and $ \\mathsf{Z} $ is the readout of the probe. Post-Measurement State POVMs themselves cannot determine the post-measurement state. The actual determination of the post-measurement state depends on the specific implementation of the measurement, that is, the measurement model. For a measurement model $ \\mathfrak{M} = (\\mathcal{K},\\sigma,U,\\mathsf{Z}) $, the post-measurement state of system $ \\mathcal{H} $ is $ \\rho_x = \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathcal{K}}[U(\\rho\\otimes \\sigma) U^\\dag(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathcal{H}}\\otimes \\mathsf{Z}(x))] $, where $ \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathcal{K}}[\\cdot] $ denotes the partial","date":"2024-03-10","objectID":"/povm/:0:0","tags":["Quantum Measurement Theory"],"title":"POVM: a brief introduction","uri":"/povm/"},{"categories":["Quantum Information"],"content":"The wave function of a photon in the spacetime representation is: $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)=\\langle \\mathbf{r},t|\\psi\\rangle=\\langle 0 |E^{+}(\\mathbf{r},t)|\\psi\\rangle$ Where $\\begin{aligned} |\\mathbf{r},t\\rangle = E^{-}(\\mathbf{r},t) |0\\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k},\\lambda} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2 \\epsilon_0 V}} e^{\\mathrm{i}(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}-\\omega_{\\mathbf{k}} t)} a^\\dag_{\\mathbf{k},\\lambda} |0\\rangle \\end{aligned}$. Intuitively, this is to let the field operator $E^{-}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ create a state $|\\mathbf{r},t\\rangle$ at the spacetime point $(\\mathbf{r},t)$, and then calculate the overlap between this state and $|\\psi\\rangle$. When we talk about the spacetime modes of photons, such as Gaussian pulses, hyperbolic secant pulses, etc., we are actually referring to the wave function in the spacetime representation described above. Of course, this wave function is not in the “Schrödinger sense” because the Schrödinger equation belongs to non-relativistic quantum mechanics, while photons are relativistic particles. When we say that photons do not have a well-defined wave function, we are actually saying that they do not have a well-defined position operator. But we do have field operators $E^{\\pm}(\\mathbf{r},t)$, so we don’t need a position operator either. The tern “photon wave function” is nowadays common in literature.

Because the evolution rule of operators in the Heisenberg picture is $A\\rightarrow UAU^{\\dag}$, where $U$ is a unitary evolution operator. If $U$ is generated by $H$, then it becomes $A\\rightarrow e^{\\frac{t}{i\\hbar}H}Ae^{-\\frac{t}{i\\hbar}H}$. Example 1: Phase Shifter The Hamiltonian is $H=\\varphi n$, and the annihilation operator $a$ evolves as: $\\begin{aligned} e^{-i\\varphi n} a e^{i\\varphi n}\u0026= a + i\\varphi [n, a] - \\frac{\\varphi}{2!} [n,[n,a]] - \\cdots \\\\ \u0026= a (1+i\\varphi -\\frac{\\varphi^2}{2!} - \\cdots)\\\\ \u0026= e^{i\\varphi} a \\end{aligned}$ Example 2: Beam Splitter The Hamiltonian is $H= \\theta e^{i\\varphi} a^{\\dag}b + \\theta e^{-i\\varphi} a b^\\dag$, the evolution is as follows: $\\begin{aligned} e^{-iH} a e^{iH} \u0026= \\cos \\theta ,a + i \\sin\\theta, e^{i\\varphi} b \\\\ e^{-iH} b e^{iH} \u0026= i \\sin\\theta ,e^{-i\\varphi} a + \\cos \\theta ,b \\end{aligned}$ This is the familiar Bogoliubov Transformation. These two examples seem like using a cannon to kill a mosquito. Let’s move on to something more useful: Example 3: Two-mode Squeezed State The Hamiltonian is: $\\begin{aligned} H=i\\hbar\\left(g^*a b-g a^\\dag b^\\dag\\right) \\end{aligned}$ $\\begin{aligned} a \u0026\\rightarrow e^{\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}} a e^{-\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}} \\\\ \u0026= a + \\left[{\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}},a\\right]+\\left[{\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}},\\left[{\\frac{H}{i\\hbar}},a\\right]\\right] + \\cdots \\\\ \u0026=\\cosh(r) a - \\sinh(r)e^{i\\xi}b^\\dag \\end{aligned}$ Where $g = re^{i\\xi}$. This is well-known for SPDC and OPO. It’s difficult to compute in the Schrödinger picture, but it’s much easier using the Heisenberg picture with BCH formula. Example 4: Rotated Quadratures The generator is the total particle number $N$, canonical position operator $Q$, and canonical momentum operator $P$ evolve as: $\\begin{aligned} e^{i\\theta N} Q e^{-i\\theta N} = \\cos \\theta, Q + i \\sin \\theta, P \\\\ e^{i\\theta N} P e^{-i\\theta N} = i \\sin \\theta, Q + \\cos \\theta P \\end{aligned}$ It looks like rotating the phase space, similar to the Phase Shifter. This transformation is useful for handling Squeezed states. Even a subordinate of the BCH formula is so useful, isn’t the original formula even more powerful? Now, let’s introduce the original: $e^{X}e^{Y}=e^Z$ $Z=X+Y+{\\frac {1}{2}}[X,Y]+{\\frac {1}{12}}[X,[X,Y]]-{\\frac {1}{12}}[Y,[X,Y]]+\\cdots $ Uh, it seems a bit less practical. In reality, we often use a special case, where $[X,Y]$ is a constant, in which case the BCH formula becomes $Z=X+Y+{\\frac {1}{2}}[X,Y]$ Example 5: Displacement Operator $\\begin{aligned} D(\\alpha)\u0026=e^{\\alpha a^\\dag-\\alpha^* a} \\\\ \u0026=e^{-\\frac{1}{2}|\\alpha|^2}e^{\\alpha a^\\dag}e^{-\\alpha^* a} \\\\ \u0026=e^{\\frac{1}{2}|\\alpha|^2}e^{-\\alpha^* a}e^{\\alpha a^\\dag} \\end{aligned}$ It’s evident that the BCH formula allows us to switch flexibly between normal ordering (creation operators before annihilation operators) and anti-normal ordering. In fact, the displacement operator itself is neither normally ordered nor anti-normally ordered but symmetrically ordered. Example 6: Weyl Operator $W(q,p) = e^{i(-qP+pQ)} = e^{\\frac{i}{2}qp}U(q)V(p) = e^{-\\frac{i}{2}qp}V(p)U(q)$ Where $U(q)=e^{-iqP}$ is the position translation operator, $V(p)=e^{ipQ}$ is the momentum translation operator. According to the BCH formula, we can decouple them. This $W:\\mathbb{R}^2\\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(L^2(\\mathbb{R}))$ is called the Weyl Representation. More generally, the Weyl Transformation can quantize a probability density function in classical phase space into a density operator, conversely, the Wigner Transformation can map a density operator to a probability density function in phase space, which is called the Wigner Representation in quantum optics.

Note: If the number of written bytes is n_tx and the number of read bytes is n_rx, then we should not only write n_tx bytes to the DTR, but also write another n_rx “dummy” bytes. This is because SPI, in nature, is a full-duplex protocol – in order to receive n_rx bytes, you also need to send n_rx bytes. Finally, read the bytes out of the DRR (Data Receive Register). When the DRR is read, the read byte will be dequed. Note: depending on the scene, when receiving from the slave, the programmer may need to discard the first n_tx bytes. This is because when the master is sending data/instructions, the slave may not yet respond. Rather, the slave will not respond until the master has sent all of the bytes (instruction \u0026 data). But due to the full-duplex nature of the SPI protocol, the first n_tx dummy bytes will also be pushed into the RX FIFO. Therefore, one may need to discard those bytes. If we use the manual slave select mode, we should assert the SS signal before the transfer and de-assert the SS signal after the transfer. The following code sends two bytes [0x00 0x37] to the slave and reads one byte from the slave. #include \"xspi.h\" // axi quad spi #include \"xparameters.h\" #include \"xstatus.h\" #include \"xplatform_info.h\" #include \"xil_printf.h\" #include \"sleep.h\" #define SPI_DEVICE_ID XPAR_SPI_0_DEVICE_ID #define SPI_BASEADDR XPAR_SPI_0_BASEADDR XSpi Spi; int main() { /* * SPI Initialize */ XSpi_Config *spi_config_ptr; spi_config_ptr = XSpi_LookupConfig(SPI_DEVICE_ID); if (spi_config_ptr == NULL) { return XST_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND; } status = XSpi_CfgInitialize(\u0026Spi, spi_config_ptr, spi_config_ptr-\u003eBaseAddress); if (status != XST_SUCCESS) { return XST_FAILURE; } // Start the SPI driver so that the device is enabled.

In /dev/spidevx.y, x stands for the x-th SPI controller, and y stands for the y-th chip. The device tree is usually initialized during boot-up and is read-only. However, after the 4.14 version of the Linux kernel, we can use the “device tree overlay” (briefed as DTO from now on) to dynamically add incremental device trees. Below is a code snippet of DTO. /dts-v1/; /plugin/; / { fragment@0 { target = \u003c\u0026amba\u003e; overlay0: __overlay__ { axi_quad_spi_0: axi_quad_spi@80000000 { ... status = \"okay\"; #address-cells = \u003c1\u003e; #size-cells = \u003c0\u003e; spidev0: spidev@0 { compatible = \"spidev\"; reg = \u003c0\u003e; spi-max-frequency = \u003c5000000\u003e; }; }; }; }; }; Some points to be noted: We should add one more line /plugin/; after /dts-v1/; to show that this is an DTO file rather than an ordinary device tree file. target stands for which node is to be modified. Here it is \u003c\u0026amba\u003e, and it will be extended to the phandle of the node which has the symbol amba. For example, if the phandle of amba is 70, then \u003c\u0026amba\u003e virtually stands for \u003c70\u003e. A phandle uniquely denotes a node and is usually allocated by the device tree compiler. In most cases, we should add the -@ compiler option, which enables support for symbol. Otherwise we can only reference the nodes by their phandle, which requires de-compiling the device tree binaries.

Specifically, if the manifold is equipped with an inner product $\\langle\\mathrm{d}x^i,\\mathrm{d}x^j\\rangle=\\delta^{j}_i$, then we have: $$ \\star(\\mathrm{d}x^i \\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^j) = \\mathrm{d}x^k $$ $$\\star\\mathrm{d}x^i = \\mathrm{d}x^j\\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k$$ $$\\star(f\\, \\mathrm{d}x^i \\wedge\\mathrm{d}x^j\\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k) = f$$ $$\\star f = f\\mathrm{d}x^i \\wedge\\mathrm{d}x^j\\wedge \\mathrm{d}x^k$$ where $(i,j,k)$ is an even permutation of $(1,2,3)$. Also, note that we use a raised symbol: $\\sharp$. This is because the curl operates on tangent vector fields, not cotangent vector fields. Specifically, the curl $\\nabla\\times$ maps a tangent vector field to another tangent vector field: $\\Gamma(TM)\\rightarrow \\Gamma(TM)$. However, $f\\in \\Gamma(T^*M)$ is a cotangent vector field (a 1-form), so we first need to “raise” it to a tangent vector field: $f^\\sharp\\in \\Gamma(TM)$. This is actually the well-known index raising and lowering in physics: $g^{ij}X_i=X^j$. Similarly, $\\flat$ represents lowering a tangent vector field to a cotangent vector field: $g_{ij}X^i=X_j$. Returning to the previous example, we have a canonical isomorphism induced by the inner product: $$ \\sharp: \\star \\mathrm{d}f \\mapsto \\nabla\\times f^\\sharp $$ or written as: $$ (\\star \\mathrm{d}f)^\\sharp = \\nabla\\times f^\\sharp $$ or written as: $$ \\star \\mathrm{d}f(v) = \\langle\\nabla\\times f^\\sharp\\mid v\\rangle $$ where $f$ is a 1-form. We can also write it as: $\\nabla\\times F=(\\star \\mathrm{d} (F^\\flat))^\\sharp$ where $F=f^\\sharp$ is a tangent vector field, and $f$ is a cotangent vector field (a 1-form). Inspired by the above example, we can define the curl as: $$ \\begin{aligned} (\\nabla\\times) : \\quad \u0026 \\Gamma(TM)\\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\bigwedge^{n-2}TM\\right) \\\\ \u0026 F \\mapsto (\\star \\mathrm{d} (F^\\flat))^\\sharp \\end{aligned} $$ whe","date":"2023-06-10","objectID":"/curl_in_n_dimension/:0:3","tags":["Vector Calculus"],"title":"Curl in high dimension","uri":"/curl_in_n_dimension/"},{"categories":["Mathematical Physics"],"content":"1 Introduction In physics textbooks, we often come across the terms “pseudo-vector” and “pseudo-scalar.” In fact, on a 3-dimensional manifold, a “pseudo-vector” is the exterior product of two tangent vectors, denoted as $v\\in T_pM\\wedge T_pM=\\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$, while a “pseudo-scalar” is the exterior product of three tangent vectors, denoted as $s\\in T_pM\\wedge T_pM\\wedge T_pM=\\bigwedge^3(T_pM)$. When equipped with an inner product (or non-degenerate bilinear form), there exists a Hodge duality between $\\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$ and $\\bigwedge^1(T_pM)$, which leads us to mistakenly consider the pseudo-vector as a vector. Similarly, due to the Hodge duality between $\\bigwedge^3(T_pM)$ and $\\bigwedge^0(T_pM)$ (scalar fields), we mistakenly treat the pseudo-scalar as a scalar. In fact, a pseudo-vector on a 3-dimensional manifold is mathematically equivalent to a 2-vector (bivector). It is similar in definition to a 2-form, with the distinction that a 2-vector belongs to the exterior product of the tangent space, $v\\in\\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$, while a 2-form belongs to the exterior product of the cotangent space, $\\omega\\in\\bigwedge^2(T_p^*M)$.

It is because they exhibit exotic behaviors under space inversion transformations. However, if we consider them as the exterior product of two vectors, all the peculiar behaviors can be explained. Specifically, as shown in the figure below, under a space inversion transformation, the magnetic field reverses its direction. It’s similar to you moving in one direction, but the reflection of you in the mirror moves in the opposite direction, which is a spooky and paranormal event. The magnetic field is a bivector. If you consider it as a vector, you will encounter this spooky phenomenon in the picture: the magnetic field takes a look in the mirror and finds its head turned into feet. In fact, the magnetic field at point $p$ is not a vector but a bivector, denoted as $B|_p\\in (T_pM)\\wedge (T_pM)$. Its basis consists of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y},\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z},\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. So, there is no paranormal event happening. Under a space inversion transformation, both vectors corresponding to the magnetic field actually point in the correct directions. It’s just that humans insist on using the right-hand rule and treat a bivector as a vector, which leads to the appearance of this strange phenomenon. Although bivectors are well-defined in mathematics, we still want to ask the question: How do we visualize a bivector? The answer is: We can represent a bivector as an oriented surface element. Different-shaped surface elements that are parallel to each other and have the same area represent the same bivector. In other words, the same bivector can be depicted in infinitely many ways, as long as they are parallel, have the same area, and have the same orientation. Parallel surface elements with the same area and orientation represent the same bivector. In practice, treating a bivector as a vector using the right-hand rule is only applicable in three-dimensional manifolds. This is because only in three-dimensional manifolds does three minus two exactly equal one. In four-dimensional manifolds, since four minus two equals two, we can only dualize a bivector into another bivector, not a vector. In five-dimensional manifolds, a bivector can be dualized into a trivector, and so on. In an n-dimensional manifold, a bivector can be dualized into an (n-2)-vector.

Its basis consists of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y},\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\wedge \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$, involving a time dimension. The reason it doesn’t appear as a “pseudo-vector” is that we only consider space inversion transformations rather than time inversion transformations. If we consider the electromagnetic 2-form in the cotangent bundle (using natural units): $$ \\begin{aligned} F\u0026=E_x\\mathrm{d}t\\wedge\\mathrm{d}x+E_y\\mathrm{d}t\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y+E_z\\mathrm{d}t\\wedge\\mathrm{d}z \\\\ \u0026+B_x \\mathrm{d}y\\wedge\\mathrm{d}z + B_y \\mathrm{d}z\\wedge\\mathrm{d}x + B_z\\mathrm{d}x\\wedge\\mathrm{d}y \\end{aligned} $$ Since we can raise or lower the indices of a tensor with the help of a metric tensor, we can also write a $(2,0)$-type electromagnetic tensor with the basis formed by the exterior product of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$. However, for now, let’s adopt the $(0,2)$-type antisymmetric tensor (differential form) because it allows us to utilize the symbol $\\mathrm{d}$ for the exterior derivative. Now, let’s consider the current 1-form: $J=-\\rho\\mathrm{d}t+J_x\\mathrm{d}x+J_y\\mathrm{d}y+J_z\\mathrm{d}z$. Thus, under the Minkowski metric $\\text{diag}(-1,1,1,1)$, Maxwell’s equations can be expressed in a concise form: $$ \\left\\{\\quad \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{d}F\u0026=0 \\\\ \\star \\, \\mathrm{d}\\star F \u0026= J \\end{aligned} \\right. $$ Here, $\\star$ represents the Hodge star operator (also known as Hodge duality). As can be seen, in the language of exterior algebra, the electromagnetic field is a 2-vector or a 2-form, rather than a vector or a 1-form. The current is indeed a vector (or a 1-form), though.
