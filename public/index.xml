    <description><![CDATA[One Differential is an Infinitesimal? Physicists like to think of differentials as very small quantities, which is convenient for calculations but gives a feeling of lack of rigor.
In fact, it is indeed lacking rigor, and the second mathematical crisis arose from this.
Rigor and clarity are always complementary. Treating differentials as infinitesimal satisfies intuition but cannot withstand rational scrutiny.
Two Differential as Linear Function I like to think of differentials as a machine, for example,]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In the previous section, we discussed the principle of measuring the quantum second-order correlation function with a non-photon-number-resolving single-photon detector in the HBT experiment.
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/679453473
In this section, let&rsquo;s see what the quantum second-order correlation function is used for. In addition to the common uses such as distinguishing between super-Poissonian statistics/Poissonian statistics/sub-Poissonian statistics and distinguishing between photon bunching/anti-bunching, the HBT experiment can also be used to measure the spectral purity of multimode squeezed states.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[HBT Experiment Those who have conducted quantum optics experiments must be familiar with the Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) experiment, which can be used to measure the second-order correlation function g2. In this experiment, a beam of light is split into two using a 50:50 beamsplitter, and then each beam is detected separately by two detectors. The correlation of the intensities on both sides is measured as a function of delay, as shown in the figure below:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Projection Measurement Traditionally, a measurement, in the sense of Von Neumann, is a series of projection operators. By performing spectral decomposition on the self-adjoint operator corresponding to the observable, denoted as $ O = \sum_i \lambda_i |\varphi_i\rangle\langle\varphi_i| $, we obtain these projection operators $ |\varphi_i\rangle\langle\varphi_i| $. This part is well-known to students who have studied elementary quantum mechanics.
Besides the Von Neumann measurement, there is a more general type of measurement called Generalized Measurements or Positive Operator Valued Measures (POVMs).]]></description>

    <title>Wave Function of Photons</title>

    <description><![CDATA[The wave function of a photon in the spacetime representation is:
$\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)=\langle \mathbf{r},t|\psi\rangle=\langle 0 |E^{+}(\mathbf{r},t)|\psi\rangle$
Where $\begin{aligned} |\mathbf{r},t\rangle = E^{-}(\mathbf{r},t) |0\rangle = \sum_{\mathbf{k},\lambda} \sqrt{\frac{\hbar \omega}{2 \epsilon_0 V}} e^{\mathrm{i}(\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}} t)} a^\dag_{\mathbf{k},\lambda} |0\rangle \end{aligned}$.
Intuitively, this is to let the field operator $E^{-}(\mathbf{r},t)$ create a state $|\mathbf{r},t\rangle$ at the spacetime point $(\mathbf{r},t)$, and then calculate the overlap between this state and $|\psi\rangle$.
When we talk about the spacetime modes of photons, such as Gaussian pulses, hyperbolic secant pulses, etc.]]></description>

    <title>Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Formula</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Chinese version here
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Formula can be used to compute operator evolution in the Heisenberg picture:
$e^X Y e^{-X}=Y+[X,Y]+\frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,Y]]+\frac{1}{3!}[X,[X,[X,Y]]]+\cdots$
This formula is actually just a younger sibling of the BCH formula.
Because the evolution rule of operators in the Heisenberg picture is $A\rightarrow UAU^{\dag}$, where $U$ is a unitary evolution operator.
If $U$ is generated by $H$, then it becomes $A\rightarrow e^{\frac{t}{i\hbar}H}Ae^{-\frac{t}{i\hbar}H}$.
Example 1: Phase Shifter The Hamiltonian is $H=\varphi n$, and the annihilation operator $a$ evolves as: $\begin{aligned} e^{-i\varphi n} a e^{i\varphi n}&amp;= a + i\varphi [n, a] - \frac{\varphi}{2!]]></description>

When the user interacts with the slider, the slider value should change.
However, if you run the above codes, you will find that the printed value of the slider won&rsquo;t change at all &ndash; it will be stuck at its initial value.]]></description>
