    <description><![CDATA[One Differential is an Infinitesimal? Physicists like to think of differentials as very small quantities, which is convenient for calculations but gives a feeling of lack of rigor.
In fact, it is indeed lacking rigor, and the second mathematical crisis arose from this.
Rigor and clarity are always complementary. Treating differentials as infinitesimal satisfies intuition but cannot withstand rational scrutiny.
Two Differential as Linear Function I like to think of differentials as a machine, for example,]]></description>

    <title>Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Formula</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Chinese version here
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Formula can be used to compute operator evolution in the Heisenberg picture:
$e^X Y e^{-X}=Y+[X,Y]+\frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,Y]]+\frac{1}{3!}[X,[X,[X,Y]]]+\cdots$
This formula is actually just a younger sibling of the BCH formula.
Because the evolution rule of operators in the Heisenberg picture is $A\rightarrow UAU^{\dag}$, where $U$ is a unitary evolution operator.
If $U$ is generated by $H$, then it becomes $A\rightarrow e^{\frac{t}{i\hbar}H}Ae^{-\frac{t}{i\hbar}H}$.
Example 1: Phase Shifter The Hamiltonian is $H=\varphi n$, and the annihilation operator $a$ evolves as: $\begin{aligned} e^{-i\varphi n} a e^{i\varphi n}&amp;= a + i\varphi [n, a] - \frac{\varphi}{2!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I. Differences and Similarities in Properties Lie derivative $\mathcal{L}_V$ and covariant derivative $\nabla_V$ share many common points:
Both $\mathcal{L}_V$ and $\nabla_V$ preserve the type of tensors, mapping $\mathcal{T}^p_q(M)$ to $\mathcal{T}^p_q(M)$. $\mathcal{T}^p_q(M)$ represents the set of all smooth tensor fields of type (p, q) on $M$. Particularly, for (0,0) type tensor fields, i.e., scalar fields $f\in \mathcal{F}(M)$, we have $\mathcal{L}_V f=\nabla_V f=Vf$.
Both satisfy linearity and the Leibniz rule: $ \begin{aligned} \mathcal{L}_V(\mu A + \lambda B) &amp;= \mu \mathcal{L}_V A + \lambda \mathcal{L}_V B, \\ \mathcal{L}_V (A \otimes B) &amp;= (\mathcal{L}_V A)\otimes B + A \otimes (\mathcal{L}_V B) \end{aligned} $]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[1 Differential Forms Before introducing the concept of curl, we need to first introduce differential forms and the exterior derivative.
An n-form can be defined as an alternating multilinear mapping $\omega:(T_p^*M)^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. It maps multiple vectors to a real number. Additionally, it satisfies the alternating property, meaning that exchanging two input vectors results in an output multiplied by a negative sign.
Therefore, an n-form can be explicitly defined as follows:]]></description>

    <title>What on earth are the pseudovectors?</title>

    <description><![CDATA[1 Introduction In physics textbooks, we often come across the terms &ldquo;pseudo-vector&rdquo; and &ldquo;pseudo-scalar.&rdquo;
In fact, on a 3-dimensional manifold, a &ldquo;pseudo-vector&rdquo; is the exterior product of two tangent vectors, denoted as $v\in T_pM\wedge T_pM=\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$, while a &ldquo;pseudo-scalar&rdquo; is the exterior product of three tangent vectors, denoted as $s\in T_pM\wedge T_pM\wedge T_pM=\bigwedge^3(T_pM)$.
When equipped with an inner product (or non-degenerate bilinear form), there exists a Hodge duality between $\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$ and $\bigwedge^1(T_pM)$, which leads us to mistakenly consider the pseudo-vector as a vector.]]></description>
