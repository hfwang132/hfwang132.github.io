    <description><![CDATA[One Differential is an Infinitesimal? Physicists like to think of differentials as very small quantities, which is convenient for calculations but gives a feeling of lack of rigor.
In fact, it is indeed lacking rigor, and the second mathematical crisis arose from this.
Rigor and clarity are always complementary. Treating differentials as infinitesimal satisfies intuition but cannot withstand rational scrutiny.
Two Differential as Linear Function I like to think of differentials as a machine, for example,]]></description>
