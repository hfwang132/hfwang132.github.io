    <description><![CDATA[<p>Does the idler light passing through the optical fiber amplifier still entangle with the signal light, which is produced by SPDC?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider two extremes:</p>
<p>Extreme 1: The gain of the amplifier is equal to 1, that is, there is no gain at all.</p>
<p>In this case, the amplifier acts as if it has done nothing and is an identity channel. So, of course, the entanglement will still be maintained. (Actually, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the case. Even if the gain is zero, additional noise may be introduced, but we ignore it here for now).</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This article aims to derive the coherent state of a laser from basic quantum dynamics.</p>
<p>Consider the interaction between a two-level system and a single-mode light field, where the frequency of the light field equals the energy level difference.</p>
<p>The two-level system initially starts in the excited state $|e\rangle$, and the light field is in the vacuum state $|0\rangle$.</p>
<p>According to the Jaynes-Cummings model, even if the light field is in the vacuum state, spontaneous emission will occur. After a short period, the quantum state evolves from $|e,0\rangle$ to:</p>]]></description>

    <title>Orbital angular momentum of photons</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>A paper published in PRA in 1992 <a href="#ref_1" rel="">[1]</a> pointed out that photons also have orbital angular momentum (OAM). Compared to spin angular momentum (i.e., polarization, SAM) which can only take $\pm \hbar$, orbital angular momentum can take any integer multiple of $\hbar$. Such orbital angular momentum can be carried by helical wavefronts.</p>
<p>You might be surprised: did people only discover this in 1992? In fact, helical wavefronts had been studied before 1992; photons carrying angular momentum greater than $\hbar$ had already been predicted by atomic physics (though they originate from higher-order transition processes, which do not satisfy the selection rules and thus have very low probabilities, making them practically unobservable in experiments). It wasn&rsquo;t until 1992 that Allen et al. pointed out that light beams with helical wavefronts carry quantized orbital angular momentum.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="quantum-state-tomography">Quantum State Tomography</h2>
<p>Quantum state tomography is the process of deducing the [quantum state] based on the [results of measurements on a quantum state ensemble]. Its formulation is straightforward, as follows:</p>
<p>Given a series of measurement operators ${\Pi_1, \ldots, \Pi_n}$ and their corresponding measurement probabilities $p_k = \operatorname{Tr}[\rho \Pi_k]$, find the quantum state $\rho$.</p>
<p>In other words, in these $n$ equations $p_k = \operatorname{Tr}[\rho \Pi_k]$, given $p_k$ and $\Pi_k$, find $\rho$.</p>]]></description>

    <title>What is the relationship between photons and electromagnetic field wave packets?</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="a-wave-packet-can-correspond-to-a-photon">A wave packet can correspond to a photon</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: A photon can be in a <strong>coherent superposition</strong> state of different frequencies: $|\psi\rangle=\sum_{k}c_k|k\rangle,\quad \sum_k|c_k|^2=1$, at which point the photon can behave as a wave packet.</p>
<p>You can imagine <strong>an atom de-exciting and emitting a photon</strong>, and this photon will indeed behave as a wave packet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some may argue: excluding various non-ideal factors, the linewidth of this photon only depends on natural broadening (lifetime), making it look like a single frequency, thus poorly localized, and not considered a wave packet. Indeed so.<br>
However, if we consider a single photon produced by a pulsed pump in a low-gain regime parametric process, its natural linewidth is very large. At this point, it is indeed in a coherent superposition state of different frequencies and behaves as a well-localized wave packet in the time domain.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Probing the spectral purity with unheralded g2 measurements in HBT experiment</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In the previous section, we discussed the principle of measuring the quantum second-order correlation function with a non-photon-number-resolving single-photon detector in the HBT experiment.</p>
<p><a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/679453473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/679453473</a><br>
In this section, let&rsquo;s see what the quantum second-order correlation function is used for. In addition to the common uses such as distinguishing between super-Poissonian statistics/Poissonian statistics/sub-Poissonian statistics and distinguishing between photon bunching/anti-bunching, the HBT experiment can also be used to measure the spectral purity of multimode squeezed states.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="hbt-experiment">HBT Experiment</h2>
<p>Those who have conducted quantum optics experiments must be familiar with the Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) experiment, which can be used to measure the second-order correlation function g2. In this experiment, a beam of light is split into two using a 50:50 beamsplitter, and then each beam is detected separately by two detectors. The correlation of the intensities on both sides is measured as a function of delay, as shown in the figure below:</p>]]></description>

    <title>Wave function of photons</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The wave function of a photon in the spacetime representation is:</p>
<p>$\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)=\langle \mathbf{r},t|\psi\rangle=\langle 0 |E^{+}(\mathbf{r},t)|\psi\rangle$</p>
<p>Where $\begin{aligned} |\mathbf{r},t\rangle = E^{-}(\mathbf{r},t) |0\rangle = \sum_{\mathbf{k},\lambda} \sqrt{\frac{\hbar \omega}{2 \epsilon_0 V}} e^{\mathrm{i}(\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}} t)} a^\dag_{\mathbf{k},\lambda} |0\rangle \end{aligned}$.</p>
<p>Intuitively, this is to let the field operator $E^{-}(\mathbf{r},t)$ create a state $|\mathbf{r},t\rangle$ at the spacetime point $(\mathbf{r},t)$, and then calculate the overlap between this state and $|\psi\rangle$.</p>
<p>When we talk about the spacetime modes of photons, such as Gaussian pulses, hyperbolic secant pulses, etc., we are actually referring to the wave function in the spacetime representation described above.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Formula</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Chinese version <a href="../zh-cn/bch/" rel="">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Formula</strong> can be used to compute operator evolution in the Heisenberg picture:</p>
<p>$e^X Y e^{-X}=Y+[X,Y]+\frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,Y]]+\frac{1}{3!}[X,[X,[X,Y]]]+\cdots$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This formula is actually just a younger sibling of the BCH formula.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the evolution rule of operators in the Heisenberg picture is $A\rightarrow UAU^{\dag}$, where $U$ is a unitary evolution operator.</p>
<p>If $U$ is generated by $H$, then it becomes $A\rightarrow e^{\frac{t}{i\hbar}H}Ae^{-\frac{t}{i\hbar}H}$.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1: Phase Shifter</strong>
The Hamiltonian is $H=\varphi n$, and the annihilation operator $a$ evolves as:
$\begin{aligned} e^{-i\varphi n} a e^{i\varphi n}&amp;= a + i\varphi [n, a] - \frac{\varphi}{2!} [n,[n,a]] - \cdots \\ &amp;= a (1+i\varphi -\frac{\varphi^2}{2!} - \cdots)\\ &amp;= e^{i\varphi} a \end{aligned}$</p>]]></description>

    <title>What is the significance of complex numbers in describing EM waves?</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In classical mechanics, complex numbers are merely a mathematical tool used to simplify calculations.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, complex numbers are not just a mathematical trick, but have a certain physical significance. Consider the classical vector potential:</p>
<p>$\begin{aligned} \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t)=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \left( A_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}}t)} + \text{c.c.}\right)\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \end{aligned}$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>where $\mathbf{k}$ and $\lambda$ represent the spatial and polarization modes respectively</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quantizing it yields the vector potential operator in the Heisenberg picture:</p>
<p>$\begin{aligned} \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t)=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \left( C_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}\hat{a}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega_{\mathbf{k}}t)} + C_{\mathbf{k}\lambda}^{*}\hat{a}^{\dag}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}+\omega_{\mathbf{k}}t)}\right)\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{k}\lambda} \end{aligned}$</p>]]></description>
