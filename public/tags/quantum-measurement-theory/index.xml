    <description><![CDATA[<p>Common sense tells us that an actual position measurement will not produce a delta function, as the delta function itself is pathological. So what should the collapsed state of an actual position measurement look like?</p>
<hr>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>Let the wave function of the system to be measured be $\varphi(x)$, then the collapsed wave function is:</p>
<p>$\varphi^{(q)}(x) = \mathcal{A}\psi(q-gx) \varphi(x)$</p>
<p>where $\psi(x)$ is the initial wave function of the instrument&rsquo;s pointer. $q$ is the reading of the instrument&rsquo;s pointer. $g$ is the coupling strength between the instrument and the system to be measured. $\begin{aligned} \mathcal{A} = \left[\int_\mathbb{R}\psi(q-gx) \varphi(x)\right]^{-1} \end{aligned}$ is the appropriate normalization constant.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Many physicists use an example to explain quantum entanglement to the public:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you have two boxes, one containing pizza and the other a burger. Before opening the boxes, you cannot know what is inside. Alice and Bob each take a box and move to distant locations. When Alice opens her box, she instantly knows what is in Bob&rsquo;s box far away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This example must be wrong&hellip; because it doesn&rsquo;t involve quantum mechanics at all.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="projection-measurement">Projection Measurement</h1>
<p>Traditionally, a measurement, in the sense of Von Neumann, is a series of projection operators. By performing spectral decomposition on the self-adjoint operator corresponding to the observable, denoted as $ O = \sum_i \lambda_i |\varphi_i\rangle\langle\varphi_i| $, we obtain these projection operators $ |\varphi_i\rangle\langle\varphi_i| $. This part is well-known to students who have studied elementary quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Besides the Von Neumann measurement, there is a more general type of measurement called Generalized Measurements or Positive Operator Valued Measures (POVMs).</p>]]></description>
