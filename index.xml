An n-form can be defined as an alternating multilinear mapping $\omega:(T_p^*M)^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. It maps multiple vectors to a real number. Additionally, it satisfies the alternating property, meaning that exchanging two input vectors results in an output multiplied by a negative sign.
Therefore, an n-form can be explicitly defined as follows:</description></item><item><title>What on earth are the pseudovectors?</title><link>http://example.com/pseudovectors/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 02:21:13 +0800</pubDate><author>hfwang</author><guid>http://example.com/pseudovectors/</guid><description><![CDATA[1 Introduction In physics textbooks, we often come across the terms &ldquo;pseudo-vector&rdquo; and &ldquo;pseudo-scalar.&rdquo;
In fact, on a 3-dimensional manifold, a &ldquo;pseudo-vector&rdquo; is the exterior product of two tangent vectors, denoted as $v\in T_pM\wedge T_pM=\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$, while a &ldquo;pseudo-scalar&rdquo; is the exterior product of three tangent vectors, denoted as $s\in T_pM\wedge T_pM\wedge T_pM=\bigwedge^3(T_pM)$.
When equipped with an inner product (or non-degenerate bilinear form), there exists a Hodge duality between $\bigwedge^2(T_pM)$ and $\bigwedge^1(T_pM)$, which leads us to mistakenly consider the pseudo-vector as a vector.]]></description></item><item><title>Blog Migration</title><link>http://example.com/blog_migration/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 01:51:11 +0800</pubDate><author>hfwang</author><guid>http://example.com/blog_migration/</guid><description>I recently discovered this fantastic tool for creating personal websites - Hugo.
