### 1 Differential Forms

Before introducing the concept of curl, we need to first introduce differential forms and the exterior derivative.

An n-form can be defined as an alternating multilinear mapping $\omega:(T_p^\*M)^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. It maps multiple vectors to a real number. Additionally, it satisfies the alternating property, meaning that exchanging two input vectors results in an output multiplied by a negative sign.

Therefore, an n-form can be explicitly defined as follows:

$$
\omega^1\wedge \omega^2\wedge\cdots\wedge \omega^n(v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_n)= \begin{vmatrix} \omega^1(v_1) & \cdots & \omega^{1}(v_n) \\\\\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\\\ \omega^n(v_1) & \cdots & \omega^n(v_n) \end{vmatrix}\in \mathbb{R}
$$

The set of all n-forms on $T_p^\*M$ can be written as $\bigwedge\_n(T_p^\*M)$.

As for "differential forms," they differ from "forms" in that they are the "forms' fields," meaning that at each point on the manifold, there resides a form. In other words, "forms" are specific to a point, while "differential forms" are specific to the entire manifold.

### 2 Exterior Derivative

The definition of the exterior derivative is as follows:

The exterior derivative is a mapping $\mathrm{d}: \bigwedge^n(T_p^\*M) \rightarrow \bigwedge^{(n+1)}(T_p^\*M)$, which acts on an differential n-form: $\varphi = \sum_I f_I \mathrm{d}x^I = \sum_{(i_1,\cdots,i_n)} f_{(i_1,\cdots,i_n)} \mathrm{d}x^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge\mathrm{d}x^{i_n}$, and yields an differential (n+1)-form:

$\mathrm{d}\varphi = \sum_I \sum_i \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial x_i} \mathrm{d}x_i\wedge x_I$.

### 3 Curl in N Dimensions

In the following example, we will explore the relationship between curl and exterior derivative:

However, $f\in \Gamma(T^*M)$ is a cotangent vector field (a 1-form), so we first need to "raise" it to a tangent vector field: $f^\sharp\in \Gamma(TM)$. This is actually the well-known index raising and lowering in physics: $g^{ij}X_i=X^j$. Similarly, $\flat$ represents lowering a tangent vector field to a cotangent vector field: $g_{ij}X^i=X_j$.

Inspired by the above example, we can define the curl as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\nabla\times) : \quad & \Gamma(TM)\rightarrow \Gamma\left(\bigwedge^{n-2}TM\right) \\\\
& F \mapsto (\star \mathrm{d} (F^\flat))^\sharp
\end{aligned}
$$

where $F$ is a tangent vector field, $F^\flat$ is a cotangent vector field (a 1-form), $\mathrm{d} (F^\flat)$ is a 2-form, and $\star \mathrm{d} (F^\flat)$ is an differential (n-2)-form.

**Therefore, the curl of a tangent vector field $F$ on an $n$-dimensional manifold, denoted as $(\star \mathrm{d} (F^\flat))^\sharp$, is an $(n-2,0)$-type antisymmetric tensor field, or simply an $(n-2)$-vector field.**

In a three-dimensional manifold, the curl reduces to a tangent vector field. In a two-dimensional manifold, the curl reduces to a scalar field.
