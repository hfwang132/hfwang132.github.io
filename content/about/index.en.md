# About Me

This is Haifei's personal website. He loves physics (his major), mathematics (not very good at it), and EECS (just for fun).

He graduated from Wuhan University with a bachelor's degree and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the [National University of Singapore - Centre for Quantum Technologies](https://quantumlah.org).

In his spare time, he enjoys playing the keyboard, drums, and appreciating jazz music.
