      Hi! I’m Haifei Wang (王海飞). Welcome to my personal page.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love physics, mathematics, and electrical engineering &amp; computer science (EECS). Naturally, I’ve gravitated to the intersection of these fields—quantum computing and, more broadly, quantum science.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re living through a new era of quantum science, where researchers can control quantum systems with unprecedented precision for real-world applications. Progress now depends not only on deep physical insight, but equally on careful engineering, robust tooling, and scalable systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m especially interested in embedded systems and hardware–software co-design for scientific instruments (e.g., quantum processors, RF signal chains, time-to-digital converters, arbitrary waveform generators, etc). Quantum engineering often hinges on exquisite timing control. For example, measurement-based quantum computing and time-multiplexed photon sources demand real-time feed-forward with nano- or even sub-nanosecond latency. Cold-atom (AMO) experiments require precisely orchestrated, multi-channel timing sequences. Superconducting quantum processors rely on RF engineering with high-sample-rate ADCs/DACs and flexible digital signal processing. Meeting these requirements typically calls for FPGAs—reconfigurable hardware that offers both low latency and high throughput. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I received my bachelor’s degree from Wuhan University and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the
      <a href="https://quantumlah.org">National University of Singapore – Centre for Quantum Technologies</a>,
      supervised by Prof. Weibo Gao. My current work focuses on building reliable control stacks for quantum experiments, including FPGA-based timing, real-time signal processing, and software interfaces that make complex experiments reproducible and scalable.
