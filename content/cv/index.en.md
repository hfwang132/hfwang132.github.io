# Research Experience

### Research Assistant, *Department of Physics, Fudan University*, Jul 2021 - Aug 2021

Advisor: Professor Yuanbo Zhang (Department of Physics, Fudan University, zhyb@fudan.edu.cn)

- **Description**: An auto-calibrator for STM (scanning tunneling microscope) tips. At present, STM tips are manually calibrated. An automatic calibration software would save plenty of time.
- **My Work**: Based on existing LabVIEW APIs and DOS spectrum data, developed a python package to auto-calibrate the STM tips.
- **Results**: The developed python package has APIs that
    - detect the edges and dirts on the surface of the sample, 
    - judge whether the tip is sharp enough, 
    - perform bias spectroscopy in clean areas to judge whether there are impurity atoms on the tip, and
    - calibrate the tip.

### Research Assistant, *School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University*, Mar 2021 -- Jun 2021

Advisor: Professor Shengjun Yuan (Department of Physics, Wuhan University, s.yuan@whu.edu.cn)

- **Description**: A time-dependent Schrodinger equation solver based on the Trotter-Suzuki method.
- **My Work**: Learned about the algorithm in the paper and wrote a program to realize the algorithm. Later optimized the algorithm on FPGA and achieved 200+ times acceleration.
- **Results**: Performed nanoscale simulation and reproduced the paper's results.

### Team Leader, College Integrated Circuits Competition of China, Mar 2022 -- Jul 2022

[http://univ.ciciec.com/](http://univ.ciciec.com/)

Advisor: Professor Sheng Chang (Department of Physics, Wuhan University, changsheng@whu.edu.cn)

- **Description**: An FPGA CNN accelerator for SSD MobileNetV1 based on Intel Cyclone V SoC.
- **My Work**:
    - pruning and quantization of the model, and
    - optimization of the interaction between PS (processing system) and PL (programmable logic), including 
        - the use of openMP and NEON assembly to accelerate PS operations and,
        - the implementation of double buffering to increase PL throughput.
- **Results**: The inference time of an image was reduced from 1000+ ms to 210 ms. The project has won the second prize in the Central China Division.

### Teaching Assistant, *2022 AMD-Xilinx Summer School, China*, Jul 2022 -- Aug 2022

[https://openhw.org/summer_school.html](https://openhw.org/summer_school.html)

- **Description**: About 800 students with various backgrounds participated in the 2022 AMD-Xilinx Summer School and learned about high-level synthesis, Xilinx's PYNQ platform, and Xilinx's latest technology Vitis AI.
- **My Work**: As TA of one of the 30 classes, arrange for students to use the remote laboratory, collect students' questions and feedback, and provide technical support.

### Intern, *Xilinx Technology Shanghai Ltd.*, Mar 2023 -- Jun 2023

- **Description**: SDR software-hardware codesign based on AD9361 RF-tranceiver and the PYNQ framework.
    - AD9361 is an RF transceiver chip designed by ADI, and has found tremendous applications in software-defined radios (SDR).
    - PYNQ is a framework that allows users to access the programmable logic from the application level, boosting hardware verification and software development.
    - In this project, we build a custom Linux Kernel, supporting both PYNQ and AD9361, making it possible to develop high-level SDR applications while utilizing the power and flexibility of heterogeneous platforms.
- **My work**:
    - built a customized Linux kernel with support for AD9361 and PYNQ drivers,
    - ported the hardware design from the ZCU102 board to the PYNQ-ZU board, and
    - developed a simple FM demodulation application based on the PYNQ framework.
- **Skills involved**
    - High Level Synthesis (HLS) for DSP algorithms
    - PS-PL co-debugging
    - Embedded Linux device trees
    - Baremetal application development
      - Baremetal programming of the SPI IP Core
    - Linux OS application development
      - C libraries for SPI communication
      - Python wrapping of the C libraries for the ease of use
